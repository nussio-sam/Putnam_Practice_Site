# Putnam_Practice_Site
## About
This Putnam Practice site is a full-stack web application designed to use AI for real human study habits, not just answer-dropping based on unresearched data. The [Putnam Exam](https://maa.org/putnam/) is *the* most prestigious university-level mathematics exam in America, with rigor placed at the #1 priority. Creative problem solving and designing fully-inclusive proofs are the skills necessary to earn your place in the top 500, and misuse of AI certainly leads to a lack of creativity and rigor in every aspect of life. This is why I use HuggingFace to design a hint system that refuses to hold your hand.

This project adheres to a high standard of test and documentation coverage, with a goal of 80+% test coverage for API, AI models, React components, and E2E with Cypress. As a practice project, I maintain a single core doctrine:
- Learn a tool to production capacity, and utilize every capability possible

## Why a Monorepo?
I designed this application to be for my personal use case, as it feels a very unique niche in the STEM world. Compared to the large amount of software developers in the American university system, not many students take the Putnam Exam. Therefore, the monorepo design was due to ease of use on my machine, with a beginner-friendly git tree as the top priority (as I am clearly a beginner).

## Contact Me
Obviously, as a university student, I am always looking to learn from those better than me. If you feel like there is a design pattern or feature of a tool I am using that I do not understand properly, please feel free to reach out:
