      "content": "Let $[n]$ denote the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$, and let $f_n$ denote the\nnumber of minimal selfish subsets of $[n]$.  Then the number of\nminimal selfish subsets of $[n]$ not containing $n$ is equal to\n$f_{n-1}$.  On the other hand, for any minimal selfish subset of $[n]$\ncontaining $n$, by subtracting 1 from each element, and then taking\naway the element $n-1$ from the set, we obtain a minimal selfish\nsubset of $[n-2]$ (since $1$ and $n$ cannot both occur in a selfish\nset).  Conversely, any minimal selfish subset of $[n-2]$ gives rise to\na minimal selfish subset of $[n]$ containing $n$ by the inverse\nprocedure.  Hence the number of minimal selfish subsets of $[n]$\ncontaining $n$ is $f_{n-2}$.  Thus we obtain $f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$.\nSince $f_1=f_2=1$, we have $f_n=F_n$, where $F_n$ denotes the $n$th\nterm of the Fibonacci sequence."
