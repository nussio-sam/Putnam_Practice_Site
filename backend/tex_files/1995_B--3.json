      "content": "For $n=1$ we obviously get 45, while for $n=3$ the answer is 0\nbecause it both changes sign (because determinants are alternating)\nand remains unchanged (by symmetry) when you switch any two rows other\nthan the first one. So only $n=2$ is left. By the multilinearity of\nthe determinant, the answer is the determinant of the matrix whose\nfirst (resp. second) row is the sum of all possible first (resp.\nsecond) rows. There are 90 first rows whose sum is the vector $(450,\n405)$, and 100 second rows whose sum is $(450, 450)$. Thus the answer\nis $450\\times 450 - 450 \\times 405 = 45 \\times 450 = 20250.$"
