      "content": "Clearly $x_{n+1}$ is a polynomial in $c$ of degree $n$,\nso it suffices to identify $n$ values of $c$ for which $x_{n+1} =\n0$. We claim these are $c = n-1-2r$ for $r=0,1,\\dots, n-1$; in this\ncase, $x_k$ is the coefficient of $t^{k-1}$ in the polynomial\n$f(t) = (1-t)^r (1+t)^{n-1-r}$. This can be verified by noticing that\n$f$ satisfies the differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = \\frac{n-1-r}{1+t} - \\frac{r}{1-t}\n\\]\n(by logarithmic differentiation) or equivalently,\n\\begin{align*}\n(1-t^2) f'(t) &= f(t) [(n-1-r)(1-t) - r(1+t)] \\\\\n&= f(t) [(n-1-2r)  - (n-1)t]\n\\end{align*}\nand then taking the coefficient of $t^{k}$ on both sides:\n\\begin{gather*}\n(k+1) x_{k+2} - (k-1) x_k = \\\\\n(n-1-2r) x_{k+1} - (n-1) x_{k}.\n\\end{gather*}\nIn particular, the largest such $c$ is $n-1$, and $x_k =\n\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ for $k= 1, 2, \\dots, n$.\n\nGreg Kuperberg has suggested an alternate approach to show directly\nthat $c=n-1$ is the largest root, without computing the others. Note\nthat the condition $x_{n+1} = 0$ states that $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is an\neigenvector of the matrix\n\\[\nA_{ij} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} i & j = i + 1 \\\\ n-j & j=i-1 \\\\\n0&\\mbox{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\nwith eigenvalue $c$. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, $A$ has a unique\neigenvector with positive entries, whose eigenvalue has modulus\ngreater than or equal to that of any other eigenvalue, which proves\nthe claim."
