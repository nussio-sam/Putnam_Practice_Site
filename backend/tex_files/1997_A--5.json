      "content": "We may discard any solutions for which $a_1 \\neq a_2$, since those come in\npairs; so assume $a_1 = a_2$.  Similarly, we may assume that $a_3 = a_4$,\n$a_5 = a_6$, $a_7 = a_8$, $a_9=a_{10}$.  Thus we get the equation\n\\[\n2/a_1 + 2/a_3 + 2/a_5 + 2/a_7 + 2/a_9 = 1.\n\\]\nAgain, we may assume $a_1 = a_3$ and $a_5 = a_7$, so we get $4/a_1 + 4/a_5\n+ 2/a_9 = 1$; and $a_1 = a_5$, so $8/a_1 + 2/a_9 = 1$.  This implies that\n$(a_1-8)(a_9-2) = 16$, which by counting has 5 solutions.  Thus $N_{10}$\nis odd."
