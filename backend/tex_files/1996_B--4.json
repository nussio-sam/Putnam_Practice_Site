      "content": "Suppose such a matrix $A$ exists.  If the eigenvalues of $A$ (over\nthe complex numbers) are distinct, then there exists a complex\nmatrix $C$ such that $B=CAC^{-1}$ is diagonal.  Consequently,\n$\\sin B$ is diagonal.  But then $\\sin A=C^{-1}(\\sin B)C$ must\nbe diagonalizable, a contradiction.  Hence the eigenvalues of $A$\nare the same, and $A$ has a conjugate $B=CAC^{-1}$ over\nthe complex numbers of the form\n\\[\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nx & y\\\\\n0 & x\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\]\nA direct computation shows that\n\\[\n\\sin B = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\sin x & y\\cdot \\cos x\\\\\n0 & \\sin x\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\]\nSince $\\sin A$ and $\\sin B$ are conjugate, their eigenvalues\nmust be the same, and so we must have $\\sin x=1$.  This implies\n$\\cos x=0$, so that $\\sin B$ is the identity matrix, as must be $\\sin\nA$, a contradiction.\nThus $A$ cannot exist.\n\nAlternate solution (due to Craig Helfgott and Alex Popa):\nDefine both $\\sin A$ and $\\cos A$ by the usual power series.\nSince $A$ commutes with itself, the power series identity\n\\[\n\\sin^2 A+\\cos^2 A = I\n\\]\nholds.  But if $\\sin A$ is the given matrix, then by the\nabove identity, $\\cos^2 A$ must equal\n$\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -2\\cdot 1996\\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\nwhich is a nilpotent matrix.  Thus $\\cos A$ is also nilpotent.\nHowever, the square of any $2\\times 2$ nilpotent matrix must be zero\n(e.g., by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem).  This is a contradiction."
