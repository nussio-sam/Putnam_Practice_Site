      "content": "We first consider the case $c \\leq 1/4$; we shall show in this case\n$f$ must be constant. The relation\n\\[\nf(x) = f(x^2 + c) = f((-x)^2 + c) = f(-x)\n\\]\nproves that $f$ is an even function. Let $r_1 \\leq r_2$ be the roots of\n$x^2 + c - x$, both of which are real. If $x > r_{2}$, define $x_{0} =\nx$ and $x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{x_{n} - c}$ for each positive integer $x$. By\ninduction on $n$, $r_{2} < x_{n+1} < x_{n}$ for all $n$, so the\nsequence $\\{x_{n}\\}$ tends to a limit $L$ which is a root of $x^{2} +\nc = x$ not less than $r_{2}$. Of course this means $L = r_{2}$.\nSince $f(x) = f(x_{n})$ for all $n$ and $x_{n} \\to r_{2}$, we\nconclude $f(x) = f(r_{2})$, so $f$ is constant on $x \\geq r_{2}$.\n\nIf $r_{1} < x < r_{2}$ and $x_{n}$ is defined as before, then by\ninduction, $x_{n} < x_{n+1} < r_{2}$. Note that the\nsequence can be defined because $r_{1} > c$; the latter follows by\nnoting that the polynomial $x^{2} - x + c$ is positive at $x = c$ and\nhas its minimum at $1/2 > c$, so both roots are greater than $c$. In\nany case, we deduce that $f(x)$ is also constant on $r_{1} \\leq x \\leq\nr_{2}$.\n\nFinally, suppose $x < r_{1}$. Now define $x_{0} = x, x_{n+1} =\nx_{n}^{2} + c$. Given that $x_{n} < r_{1}$, we have $x_{n+1} >\nx_{n}$. Thus if we had $x_{n} < r_{1}$ for all $n$, by the same argument as\nin the first case we deduce $x_{n} \\to r_{1}$ and so $f(x) =\nf(r_{1})$. Actually, this doesn't happen; eventually we have $x_{n} >\nr_{1}$, in which case $f(x) = f(x_{n}) = f(r_{1})$ by what we have\nalready shown. We conclude that $f$ is a constant function. (Thanks\nto Marshall Buck for catching an inaccuracy in a previous version of\nthis solution.)\n\nNow suppose $c > 1/4$. Then the sequence $x_n$ defined by $x_0 = 0$\nand $x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$ is strictly increasing and has no limit\npoint. Thus if we define $f$ on $[x_0, x_1]$ as any continuous\nfunction with equal values on the endpoints, and extend the definition\nfrom $[x_n, x_{n+1}]$ to $[x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}]$ by the relation $f(x) =\nf(x^2 + c)$, and extend the definition further to $x < 0$ by the\nrelation $f(x) = f(-x)$, the resulting function has the desired\nproperty. Moreover, any function with that property clearly has this form."
