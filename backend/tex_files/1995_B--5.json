      "content": "This problem is dumb if you know the Sprague-Grundy theory of normal\nimpartial games (see Conway, Berlekamp and Guy, {\\it Winning Ways},\nfor details). I'll describe how it applies here. To each position you\nassign a {\\em nim-value} as follows. A position with no moves (in\nwhich case the person to move has just lost) takes value 0. Any other\nposition is assigned the smallest number not assigned to a valid move\nfrom that position.\n\nFor a single pile, one sees that an empty pile has value 0, a pile of\n2 has value 1, a pile of 3 has value 2, a pile of 4 has value 0, a\npile of 5 has value 1, and a pile of 6 has value 0.\n\nYou add piles just like in standard Nim: the nim-value of the\ncomposite of two games (where at every turn you pick a game and make\na move there) is the ``base 2 addition without carries'' (i.e.\\\nexclusive OR) of the nim-values of the constituents. So our starting\nposition, with piles of 3, 4, 5, 6, has nim-value $2 \\oplus 0 \\oplus\n1 \\oplus 0 = 3$.\n\nA position is a win for the player to move if and only if it has a\nnonzero value, in which case the winning strategy is to always move to\na 0 position. (This is always possible from a nonzero position and\nnever from a zero position, which is precisely the condition that\ndefines the set of winning positions.) In this case, the winning move\nis to reduce the pile of 3 down to 2, and you can easily describe the\nentire strategy if you so desire."
