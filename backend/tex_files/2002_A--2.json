      "content": "Draw a great circle through two of the points. There are two\nclosed hemispheres with this great circle as boundary, and each of\nthe other three points lies in one of them. By the pigeonhole principle,\ntwo of those three points lie in the same hemisphere, and that hemisphere\nthus contains four of the five given points.\n\nNote: by a similar argument, one can prove that among any $n+3$ points on\nan $n$-dimensional sphere, some $n+2$ of them lie on a closed hemisphere.\n(One cannot get by with only $n+2$ points: put them at the vertices of\na regular simplex.)\nNamely, any $n$ of the points lie on a great sphere, which forms the boundary\nof two hemispheres; of the remaining three points, some two lie in the\nsame hemisphere."
