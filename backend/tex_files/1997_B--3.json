      "content": "The only such $n$ are the numbers 1--4, 20--24, 100--104, and\n120--124.  For the proof let\n\\[H_n=\\sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{1}{m}\\]\nand introduce the auxiliary function\n\\[I_n=\\sum_{1\\leq m\\leq n, (m,5)=1} \\frac{1}{m}.\\]\nIt is immediate (e.g., by induction) that\n$I_n\\equiv 1,-1,1,0,0$ (mod $5$) for $n\\equiv  1,2,3,4,5$ (mod 5)\nrespectively, and moreover, we have the equality\n\\[\\label{(*)}\nH_n= \\sum_{m=0}^k \\frac{1}{5^m} I_{\\lfloor n/5^m \\rfloor},\\]\nwhere $k=k(n)$ denotes the largest integer such that $5^k\\leq n$.\nWe wish to determine those $n$ such that the above sum has nonnegative\n5--valuation.  (By the 5--valuation of a number $a$ we mean\nthe largest integer $v$ such that $a/5^v$ is an integer.)\n\nIf $\\lfloor n/5^k \\rfloor\\leq 3$, then the last term in the above sum\nhas 5--valuation $-k$, since $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ each have valuation\n0; on the other hand, all other terms must have 5--valuation strictly\nlarger than $-k$.  It follows that $H_n$ has 5--valuation exactly\n$-k$; in particular, $H_n$ has nonnegative 5--valuation in this case\nif and only if $k=0$, i.e., $n=1$, 2, or 3.\n\nSuppose now that $\\lfloor n/5^k \\rfloor=4$.  Then we must also have\n$20\\leq \\lfloor n/5^{k-1}\\rfloor \\leq 24$.  The former condition\nimplies that the last term of the above sum is $I_4/5^k=1/(12\\cdot\n5^{k-2})$, which has 5--valuation $-(k-2)$.\n\nIt is clear that $I_{20}\\equiv I_{24}\\equiv 0$ (mod 25); hence if $\\lfloor\nn/5^{k-1}\\rfloor$ equals 20 or 24, then the second--to--last term of the\nabove sum (if it exists) has valuation at least $-(k-3)$.  The\nthird--to--last term (if it exists) is of the form $I_r/5^{k-2}$, so that\nthe sum of the last term and the third to last term takes the form\n$(I_r+1/12)/5^{k-2}$.  Since $I_r$ can be congruent only to 0,1, or -1\n(mod 5), and $1/12\\equiv 3$ (mod 5), we conclude that the sum of the\nlast term and third--to--last term has valuation $-(k-2)$, while all other\nterms have valuation strictly higher.  Hence $H_n$ has nonnegative\n5--valuation in this case only when $k\\leq 2$, leading to the values\n$n=4$ (arising from $k=0$), 20,24 (arising from $k=1$ and $\\lfloor\nn/5^{k-1}\\rfloor = 20$ and 24 resp.), 101, 102, 103, and 104 (arising\nfrom $k=2$, $\\lfloor n/5^{k-1}\\rfloor = 20$) and 120, 121, 122, 123,\nand 124 (arising from $k=2$, $\\lfloor n/5^{k-1}\\rfloor=24$).\n\nFinally, suppose $\\lfloor n/5^k \\rfloor=4$ and $\\lfloor n/5^{k-1}\n\\rfloor=21$, 22, or 23.  Then as before, the first condition\nimplies that the last term of the sum in (*) has valuation $-(k-2)$,\nwhile the second condition implies that the second--to--last term in the\nsame sum has valuation $-(k-1)$.  Hence all terms in the sum (*) have\n5--valuation strictly higher than $-(k-1)$, except for the\nsecond--to--last term, and therefore $H_n$ has 5--valuation $-(k-1)$ in\nthis case.  In particular, $H_n$ is integral (mod 5) in this case if and\nonly if  $k\\leq 1$, which gives the additional values $n=21$, 22, and 23."
