      "content": "Suppose $a^{n+1} - (a+1)^n = 2001$.\nNotice that $a^{n+1} + [(a+1)^n - 1]$ is a multiple of $a$; thus\n$a$ divides $2002 = 2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nSince $2001$ is divisible by 3, we must have $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$,\notherwise one of $a^{n+1}$ and $(a+1)^n$ is a multiple of 3 and the\nother is not, so their difference cannot be divisible by 3. Now\n$a^{n+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, so we must have $(a+1)^n \\equiv 1\n\\pmod{3}$, which forces $n$ to be even, and in particular at least 2.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then $a^{n+1} - (a+1)^n \\equiv -(a+1)^n \\pmod{4}$.\nSince $n$ is even, $-(a+1)^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$. Since $2001 \\equiv 1\n\\pmod{4}$, this is impossible. Thus $a$ is odd, and so must divide\n$1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$. Moreover, $a^{n+1} - (a+1)^n \\equiv a\n\\pmod{4}$, so $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nOf the divisors of $7 \\times 11 \\times 13$, those congruent to 1 mod 3\nare precisely those not divisible by 11 (since 7 and 13 are both\ncongruent to 1 mod 3). Thus $a$ divides $7 \\times 13$. Now\n$a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ is only possible if $a$ divides $13$.\n\nWe cannot have $a=1$, since $1 - 2^n \\neq 2001$ for any $n$. Thus\nthe only possibility is $a = 13$. One easily checks that $a=13, n=2$ is a\nsolution; all that remains is to check that no other $n$ works. In fact,\nif $n > 2$, then $13^{n+1} \\equiv 2001 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\nBut $13^{n+1} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{8}$ since $n$ is even, contradiction.\nThus $a=13, n=2$ is the unique solution.\n\nNote: once one has that $n$ is even, one can use that $2002\n=a^{n+1} + 1 - (a+1)^n$ is divisible by $a+1$ to rule out cases."
