      "content": "(by Manjul Bhargava)\nLet $a(k,n)$ denote the number of sequences of length $k$ taken from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,10\\}$ and having sum $n$.\nWe prove that \n\\[\na(k,n) < 2^n \\left( \\frac{2018}{2048} \\right)^k\n\\]\nby double induction on $n+k$ and $n-k$.  The claim is clearly true when $n-k \\leq 0$ and in particular when $n=k=1$, the smallest case for $n+k$.\n\nWe categorize the sequences counted by $a(k,n)$ by whether they end in $1,2,3,4,5,6,10$; removing the last\nterm of such a sequence yields a sequence counted by $a(k-1,n-1), a(k-1,n-2), a(k-1,n-3), a(k-1,n-4), a(k-1,n-5), a(k-1,n-6), a(k-1,n-10)$, respectively.  Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\na(k,n) &= a(k-1,n-1) + \\cdots \\\\\n&\\quad + a(k-1,n-6) + a(k-1,n-10) \\\\\n&< (  2^{n-1} + \\cdots +   2^{n-6}  +  2^{n-10} ) \\left( \\frac{2018}{2048} \\right)^{k-1} \\\\\n&= 2^n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{1024} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2018}{2048} \\right)^{k-1} \\\\\n&= 2^n \\left( \\frac{1009}{1024} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2018}{2048} \\right)^{k-1} \\\\\n&= 2^n \\left( \\frac{2018}{2048} \\right)^{k}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we used directly the induction hypothesis to obtain the inequality on the second line.\nThe case $k=2018, n=3860$ yields the desired result.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nK. Soundararajan suggests the following reinterpretation of this argument. The quantity $a(k,n)$ can be interpreted as the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10})^k$. Since this polynomial has nonnegative coefficients, \nfor any $x$, we have\n\\[\na(k,n) x^n < (x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10})^k.\n\\]\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ yields the bound stated above.\n\nOn a related note, Alexander Givental suggests that the value $n=3860$ (which is otherwise irrelevant to the problem) may have been chosen for the following reason: as a function of $x$, the upper bound $x^{-n} (x+x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10})^k$\nis minimized when\n\\[\n\\frac{x(1 + 2x + \\cdots + 6x^5 + x^9)}{x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10}} = \\frac{n}{k}.\n\\]\nIn order for this to hold for $x = 1/2$, $k=2018$, one must take $n = 3860$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nFor purposes of comparison, the stated bound is about $10^{1149}$, while the trivial upper bound\ngiven by counting all sequences of length 2018 of positive integers that sum to 3860 is\n\\[\n\\binom{3859}{2017} \\sim 10^{1158}.\n\\]\nThe latter can be easily derived by a ``stars and bars'' argument: visualize each sequence of this form by representing the value $n$ by $n$ stars and inserting a bar between adjacent terms of the sequence. The resulting string of symbols consists of one star at the beginning, 2017 bar-star combinations, and 3860-2018 more stars.\n\nUsing a computer, it is practical to compute the exact cardinality of $S$ by finding the coefficient of $x^{3860}$ in\n$(x + x^2 + \\cdots + x^6 + x^{10})^{2018}$. For example, this can be done in \\texttt{Sage} in a couple of seconds as follows. (The truncation is truncated modulo $x^{4000}$ for efficiency.)\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\nsage: P.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, 4000)\nsage: f = (x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \\\n....:      x^5 + x^6 + x^10)^2018\nsage: m = list(f)[3860]\nsage: N(m)\n8.04809122940636e1146\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nThis computation shows that the upper bound of the problem differs from the true value by a factor of about 150."
