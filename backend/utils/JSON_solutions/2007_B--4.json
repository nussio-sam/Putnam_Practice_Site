      "content": "The number of pairs is $2^{n+1}$. The degree condition forces\n$P$ to have degree $n$ and leading coefficient $\\pm 1$; we may count\npairs in which $P$ has leading coefficient 1 as long as we multiply by $2$\nafterward.\n\nFactor both sides:\n\\begin{align*}\n& (P(X) + Q(X)i)(P(X) - Q(X)i) \\\\\n& = \\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\n(X - \\exp(2 \\pi i (2j+1)/(4n))) \\\\\n& \\quad \\cdot \\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\n(X + \\exp(2 \\pi i (2j+1)/(4n))).\n\\end{align*}\nThen each choice of $P,Q$ corresponds to equating $P(X) + Q(X)i$\nwith the product of some $n$ factors on the right,\nin which we choose exactly of the two factors for each $j=0,\\dots,n-1$.\n(We must take exactly $n$\nfactors because as a polynomial in $X$ with complex coefficients, $P(X) + Q(X)i$\nhas degree exactly $n$. We must choose one for each $j$ to ensure that\n$P(X) + Q(X)i$ and $P(X) -Q(X)i$ are complex conjugates, so that $P, Q$ have\nreal coefficients.) Thus there are $2^n$ such pairs;\nmultiplying by 2 to allow $P$ to have\nleading coefficient $-1$ yields the desired result.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} If we allow $P$ and $Q$ to have complex coefficients but\nstill require $\\deg(P) > \\deg(Q)$, then the number of pairs increases\nto $2\\binom{2n}{n}$, as we may choose any $n$ of the $2n$ factors of\n$X^{2n}+1$ to use to form $P(X) + Q(X)i$."
