      "content": "(by Abhinav Kumar) Define $G : \\RR \\to \\RR$ by $G(x) = \\int_0^x\ng(t)\\,dt$. By assumption, $G$ is a strictly increasing, thrice continuously\ndifferentiable function. It is also bounded: for $x>1$, we have\n\\[\n0 < G(x)-G(1) = \\int_1^x g(t)\\,dt \\leq \\int_1^x dt/t^2 = 1,\n\\]\nand similarly, for $x<-1$, we have $0 > G(x)-G(-1) \\geq -1$.\nIt follows that the image of $G$ is some open interval $(A,B)$\nand that $G^{-1}: (A,B) \\to \\RR$ is also thrice continuously differentiable.\n\nDefine $H: (A,B) \\times (A,B) \\to \\RR$ by $H(x,y) = F(G^{-1}(x), G^{-1}(y))$;\nit is twice continuously differentiable since $F$ and $G^{-1}$ are.\nBy our assumptions about $F$,\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} =\n    \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(G^{-1}(x), G^{-1}(y))\n    \\cdot \\frac{1}{g(G^{-1}(x))}\\\\\n    + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(G^{-1}(x), G^{-1}(y))\n    \\cdot \\frac{1}{g(G^{-1}(y))} = 0.\n\\end{multline*}\nTherefore $H$ is constant along any line parallel to the vector $(1,1)$,\nor equivalently, $H(x,y)$ depends only on $x-y$. We may thus write $H(x,y) =\nh(x-y)$ for some function $h$ on $(-(B-A), B-A)$, and we then have $F(x,y)\n= h(G(x) - G(y))$.  Since $F(u,u) = 0$, we have $h(0) = 0$. Also, $h$\nis twice continuously differentiable (since it can be written as $h(x)\n= H((A+B+x)/2,(A+B-x)/2)$), so $|h'|$ is bounded on the closed interval $[-(B-A)/2,\n(B-A)/2]$, say by $M$.\n\nGiven $x_1,\\dots,x_{n+1} \\in \\RR$ for some $n \\geq 2$, the numbers\n$G(x_1),\\dots,G(x_{n+1})$ all belong to $(A,B)$, so we can choose indices\n$i$ and $j$ so that $|G(x_i) - G(x_j)| \\leq (B-A)/n \\leq (B-A)/2$.  By the\nmean value theorem,\n\n\\[\n|F(x_i, x_j)| = |h(G(x_i) - G(x_j))| \\leq M \\frac{B-A}{n},\n\\]\nso the claim holds with $C = M(B-A)$."
