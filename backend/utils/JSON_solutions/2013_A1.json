      "content": "Suppose otherwise. Then each vertex $v$ is a vertex for five faces, all of which have different labels, and so the sum of the labels of the five faces incident to $v$ is at least $0+1+2+3+4 = 10$. Adding this sum over all vertices $v$ gives $3 \\times 39 = 117$, since each face's label is counted three times. Since there are $12$ vertices, we conclude that $10 \\times 12 \\leq 117$, contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nOne can also obtain the desired result by showing that any collection of five faces must contain two faces that share a vertex; it then follows that each label can appear at most $4$ times, and so the sum of all labels is at least $4(0+1+2+3+4) = 40 > 39$, contradiction."
