      "content": "If $x$ and $y$ are the sides of two squares with combined area 1, then\n$x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Suppose without loss of generality that $x \\geq y$.\nThen the shorter side of a rectangle containing both squares without\noverlap must be at least $x$, and the longer side must be at least\n$x+y$. Hence the desired value of $A$ is the maximum of $x(x+y)$.\n\nTo find this maximum, we let $x = \\cos \\theta, y = \\sin \\theta$ with\n$\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/4]$. Then we are to maximize\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\n&= \\frac 12 (1 + \\cos 2\\theta + \\sin 2\\theta) \\\\\n&= \\frac 12 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cos (2\\theta - \\pi/4) \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2}}{2},\n\\end{align*}\nwith equality for $\\theta = \\pi/8$. Hence this value is the desired\nvalue of $A$."
