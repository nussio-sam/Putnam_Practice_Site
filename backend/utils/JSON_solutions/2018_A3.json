      "content": "The maximum value is $480/49$.\nSince $\\cos(3x_i) = 4 \\cos(x_i)^3 - 3 \\cos(x_i)$, it is equivalent to maximize $4 \\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_i^3$\nfor $y_1,\\dots,y_{10} \\in [-1,1]$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_i = 0$; \nnote that this domain is compact, so the maximum value is guaranteed to exist.\nFor convenience, we establish something slightly stronger: we maximize $4 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^3$\nfor $y_1,\\dots,y_{n} \\in [-1,1]$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = 0$, where $n$ may be any even nonnegative integer up to $10$,\nand show that the maximum is achieved when $n=10$.\n\nWe first study the effect of varying $y_i$ and $y_j$ while fixing their sum. If that sum is $s$,\nthen the function $y \\mapsto y^3 + (s-y)^3$ has constant second derivative $6s$, so it is either everywhere convex or everywhere concave. Consequently, if $(y_1,\\dots,y_{n})$ achieves the maximum, then for any two indices $i<j$,\nat least one of the following must be true:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item one of $y_i$, $y_j$ is extremal (i.e., equal to $1$ or $-1$);\n\\item $y_i = y_j < 0$ (in which case $s<0$ and the local maximum is achieved above);\n\\item $y_i = -y_j$ (in which case $s=0$ above)."
