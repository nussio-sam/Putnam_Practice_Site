      "content": "Yes, such $a,b,c,d$ exist: we take\n\\[\n(a,b) = (2,1), \\qquad (c,d) = (1,2).\n\\]\nWe will represent $T$ as an $3 \\times n$ array (3 rows, $n$ columns) of integers  in which each of $1,\\dots,3n$ occurs exactly once and the rows and columns are strictly increasing; we will specialize to $n=2024$ at the end.\n\nWe first note that $T(1,1) = 1$ and $2 \\in \\{T(1,2), T(2,1)\\}$.\nFrom this, it follows that $T(2,1) < T(1,2)$ if and only if $T(2,1) = 2$.\n\nWe next recall a restricted form of the \\emph{hook length formula}\n(see the first remark for a short proof of this restricted version and the second remark for the statement of the general formula).\nConsider more generally an array consisting of (up to) three rows of lengths $n_1\\geq n_2 \\geq n_3 \\geq 0$, aligned at the left.\nLet $f(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ be the number of ways to fill this array with a permutation of the numbers $1,\\dots,n_1+n_2+n_3$ in such a way that each row increases from left to right and each column increases from top to bottom. The hook length formula then shows that $f(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ equals\n\\[\n\\frac{(n_1-n_2+1)(n_1-n_3+2)(n_2-n_3+1) (n_1+n_2+n_3)!}\n{(n_1+2)! (n_2+1)! n_3!}.\n\\]\n\nWe then note that if $T(2,1) = 2$, we obtain a array with row lengths $n, n-1, n-1$ by removing 1 and 2, relabeling each remaining $i$ as $3n+1-i$, and reflecting in both axes. The probability that $T(2,1) < T(1,2)$ is thus\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{f(n,n-1,n-1)}{f(n,n,n)}\n&= \n\\frac{(2)(3)(n+1)n}{(1)(2) (3n)(3n-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{n+1}{3n-1} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{9n-3};\n\\end{align*}\nthis is always greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$, and for $n =2024$ it is visibly less than $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nWe prove the claimed formula for $f(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ by induction on $n_1+n_2+n_3$.\nTo begin with, if $n_2 = n_3 = 0$, then the desired count is indeed $f(n_1, 0, 0) = 1$.\nNext, suppose $n_2 > 0, n_3 = 0$.\nThe entry $n_1 + n_2$ must go at the end of either the first or second row;\ncounting ways to complete the diagram from these starting points yields\n\\[\nf(n_1,n_2,0) = f(n_1-1,n_2,0) + f(n_1,n_2-1,0).\n\\]\n(This works even if $n_1 = n_2$, in which case the first row is not an option but correspondingly $f(n_2-1,n_2,0) = 0$.)\nThe induction step then follows from the identity\n\\[\n\\frac{(n_1-n_2)(n_1+1) + (n_1-n_2+2)n_2}{(n_1-n_2+1)(n_1+n_2)}  = 1.\n\\]\n(As an aside, the case $n_1 = n_2, n_3 = 0$ recovers a standard interpretation of the Catalan numbers.)\n\nFinally, suppose $n_3 > 0$. We then have\n\\begin{align*}\n&f(n_1,n_2,n_3) \\\\\n&= \nf(n_1-1,n_2,n_3) + f(n_1,n_2-1,n_3) + f(n_1,n_2,n_3-1),\n\\end{align*}\nand the induction step now reduces to the algebraic identity\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{(n_1-n_2)(n_1-n_3+1)(n_1+2)}{(n_1-n_2+1)(n_1-n_3+2)(n_1+n_2+n_3)} \\\\\n&+ \\frac{(n_1-n_2+2)(n_2-n_3)(n_2+1)}{(n_1-n_2+1)(n_2-n_3+1)(n_1+n_2+n_3)} \\\\\n&+ \\frac{(n_1-n_3+3)(n_2-n_3+2)n_3}{(n_1-n_3+2)(n_2-n_3+1)(n_1+n_2+n_3)}\n= 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nWe formulate the general hook length formula in standard terminology.\nLet $N$ be a positive integer, and consider a semi-infinite checkerboard with top and left edges. A \\emph{Ferrers diagram} is a finite subset of the squares of the board which is closed under taking a unit step towards either edge. Given a Ferrers diagram with $N$ squares, a \\emph{standard Young tableau} for this diagram is a bijection of the squares of the diagram with the integers $1,\\dots,N$ such that the numbers always increase under taking a unit step away from either edge. \n\n\nFor each square $s = (i,j)$ in the diagram, the \\emph{hook length} $h_s$ of $s$ is the number of squares $(i',j')$ in the diagram\nsuch that either $i=i', j\\leq j'$ or $i\\leq i',j=j'$ (including $s$ itself). Then the number of standard Young tableaux for this diagram equals\n\\[\n\\frac{N!}{\\prod_s h_s}.\n\\]\nFor a proof along the lines of the argument given in the previous remark, see:\nKenneth Glass and Chi-Keung Ng, A simple proof of the hook length formula,\n\\textit{American Mathematical Monthly} \\textbf{111} (2004), 700--704."
