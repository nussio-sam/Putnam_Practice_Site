      "content": "These are the integers with no $0$'s in their usual base $10$ expansion. If the usual base $10$ expansion of $N$ is $d_k 10^k + \\cdots + d_0 10^0$ and one of the digits is $0$, then there exists an $i \\leq k-1$ such that $d_i = 0$ and $d_{i+1} > 0$; then we can replace $d_{i+1} 10^{i+1} + (0) 10^i$ by $(d_{i+1}-1) 10^{i+1} + (10) 10^i$ to obtain a second base $10$ over-expansion.\n\nWe claim conversely that if $N$ has no $0$'s in its usual base $10$ expansion, then this standard form is the unique base $10$ over-expansion for $N$. This holds by induction on the number of digits of $N$: if $1\\leq N\\leq 9$, then the result is clear. Otherwise, any base $10$ over-expansion $N = d_k 10^k + \\cdots + d_1 10 + d_0 10^0$ must have $d_0 \\equiv N \\pmod{10}$, which uniquely determines $d_0$ since $N$ is not a multiple of $10$; then $(N-d_0)/10$ inherits the base $10$ over-expansion $d_k 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + d_1 10^0$, which must be unique by the induction hypothesis.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nKarl Mahlburg suggests an alternate proof of uniqueness (due to Shawn Williams):\nwrite the usual expansion $N = d_k 10^k + \\cdots + d_0 10^0$ and suppose $d_i \\neq 0$ for all $i$. Let $M = c_l 10^l + \\cdots + c_0 10^0$ be an over-expansion with at least one 10. To have $M = N$, we must have $l \\leq k$; we may pad the expansion of $M$ with zeroes to force $l=k$. Now define $e_i = c_i - d_i$; since $1 \\leq d_i \\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq c_i \\leq 10$,\nwe have $0 \\leq |e_i| \\leq 9$. Moreover, there exists at least one index $i$ with $e_i \\neq 0$, since any index for which $c_i = 10$ has this property. But if $i$ is the largest such index, we have \n\\begin{align*}\n10^i &\\leq \\left| e_i 10^i \\right| = \\left| -\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} e_i 10^i \\right| \\\\\n&\\leq \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\left| e_i| 10^i \\right| \\leq 9 \\cdot 10^{i-1} + \\cdots + 9 \\cdot 10^0,\n\\end{align*}\na contradiction."
