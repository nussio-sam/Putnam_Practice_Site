      "content": "We will assume $n \\geq 2$ hereafter, since the answer is 0 for $n=1$.\n\n\\textbf{First solution:}\nWe show that the set of rook tours from $(1,1)$ to $(n,1)$ is in bijection with\nthe set of subsets of $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$ that include $n$ and contain an even number\nof elements in total.  Since the latter set evidently contains $2^{n-2}$ elements,\nso does the former.\n\nWe now construct the bijection.  Given a rook tour $P$ from $(1,1)$ to $(n,1)$,\nlet $S=S(P)$ denote the set of all $i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ for which there is\neither a directed edge from $(i,1)$ to $(i,2)$ or from $(i,3)$ to $(i,2)$.  It\nis clear that this set $S$ includes $n$ and must contain an even number of\nelements.  Conversely, given a subset $S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{2r}=n\\}\n\\subset \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ of this type with $a_1<a_2<\\cdots<a_{2r}$,\nwe notice that there is a unique path $P$ containing\n$(a_i,2+(-1)^i),(a_1,2)$\nfor $i=1,2,\\ldots,2r$.  This establishes the desired bijection.\n\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nLet $A_n$ denote the set of rook tours beginning at $(1,1)$ and\nending at $(n,1)$, and let $B_n$ denote the set of rook tours\nbeginning at $(1,1)$ and ending at $(n,3)$.\n\nFor $n \\geq 2$, we construct a bijection between $A_n$ and $A_{n-1}\n\\cup B_{n-1}$. Any path $P$ in $A_n$ contains either the line segment\n$P_1$ between $(n-1,1)$ and $(n,1)$, or the line segment $P_2$ between\n$(n,2)$ and $(n,1)$. In the former case, $P$ must also contain the\nsubpath $P_1'$ which joins $(n-1,3)$, $(n,3)$, $(n,2)$, and $(n-1,2)$\nconsecutively; then deleting $P_1$ and $P_1'$ from $P$ and adding the\nline segment joining $(n-1,3)$ to $(n-1,2)$ results in a path in\n$A_{n-1}$. (This construction is reversible, lengthening any path in\n$A_{n-1}$ to a path in $A_n$.) In the latter case, $P$ contains the\nsubpath $P_2'$ which joins $(n-1,3)$, $(n,3)$, $(n,2)$, $(n,1)$\nconsecutively; deleting $P_2'$ results in a path in $B_{n-1}$, and\nthis construction is also reversible. The desired bijection follows.\n\nSimilarly, there is a bijection between $B_n$ and $A_{n-1} \\cup\nB_{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 2$. It follows by induction that for $n \\geq 2$,\n$|A_n| = |B_n| = 2^{n-2} (|A_1| + |B_1|)$. But $|A_1| = 0$ and $|B_1|\n= 1$, and hence the desired answer is $|A_n| = 2^{n-2}$.\n\n\\textbf{Remarks:}\nOther bijective arguments are possible: for instance, Noam Elkies\npoints out that each element of $A_n \\cup B_n$\ncontains a different one of the possible sets of\nsegments of the form $(i,2),(i+1,2)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\nRichard Stanley provides the reference: K.L.
