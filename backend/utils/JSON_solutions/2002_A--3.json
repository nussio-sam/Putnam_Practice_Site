Moreover, for each set $S$ with integer average $m$\nthat does not contain $m$, $S \\cup \\{m\\}$ also has average $m$,\nwhile for each set $T$ of more than one element with integer average\n$m$ that contains $m$, $T \\setminus \\{m\\}$ also has average $m$.\nThus the subsets other than $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\dots, \\{n\\}$ can be grouped\nin pairs, so $T_n - n$ is even."
