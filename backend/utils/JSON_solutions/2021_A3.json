      "content": "The integers $N$ with this property are those of the form $3m^2$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nIn one direction, for $N = 3m^2$, the points\n\\[\n(m,m,m), (m,-m,-m), (-m,m,-m), (-m,-m,m)\n\\]\nform the vertices of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = N$.\n\nConversely, suppose that $P_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,4$ are the vertices of an inscribed regular \ntetrahedron. Then the center of this tetrahedron must equal the center of the sphere, namely $(0,0,0)$. Consequently, these four vertices together with $Q_i = (-x_i, -y_i, -z_i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,4$ form the vertices of an inscribed cube in the sphere.\nThe side length of this cube is $(N/3)^{1/2}$, so its volume is $(N/3)^{3/2}$;\non the other hand, this volume also equals the determinant of the matrix\nwith row vectors $Q_2-Q_1, Q_3-Q_1, Q_4-Q_1$, which is an integer. Hence $(N/3)^3$ is a perfect square, as then is $N/3$."
