Otherwise, let $S$ be the set of\n$p$-tuples $(a_0,\\dots,a_{p-1}) \\in G^p$ such that $a_0 \\cdots a_{p-1} = e$;\nthen $S$ has cardinality $m^{p-1}$, which is divisible by $p$.\nNote that this set is invariant under cyclic permutation, that is,\nif $(a_0,\\dots,a_{p-1}) \\in S$, then $(a_1,\\dots,a_{p-1},a_0) \\in S$ also.\nThe fixed points under this operation are the tuples\n$(a,\\dots,a)$ with $a^p = e$; all other tuples can be grouped into orbits\nunder cyclic permutation, each of which has size $p$. Consequently,\nthe number of $a \\in G$ with $a^p = e$ is divisible by $p$; since that number\nis $n+1$ (only $e$ has order 1), this proves the claim.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by Anand Deopurkar)\nAssume that $n > 0$, and let $H$ be any subgroup of $G$ of order $p$.\nLet $S$ be the set of all elements of $G \\setminus H$\nof order dividing $p$, and let\n$H$ act on $G$ by conjugation. Each orbit has size $p$ except for those\nwhich consist of individual elements $g$ which commute with $H$.\nFor each such $g$, $g$ and $H$ generate an elementary abelian subgroup of\n$G$ of order $p^2$. However, we can group these $g$ into sets of size\n$p^2-p$ based on which subgroup they generate together with $H$.\nHence the cardinality of $S$ is divisible by $p$; adding the $p-1$\nnontrivial elements of $H$ gives $n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ as desired.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\nLet $S$ be the set of elements in $G$ having order dividing $p$, and let\n$H$ be an elementary abelian $p$-group of maximal order in $G$.  If\n$|H|=1$, then we are done.  So assume $|H|=p^k$ for some $k\\geq 1$, and\nlet $H$ act on $S$ by conjugation.  Let $T\\subset S$ denote the set of\nfixed points of this action.  Then the size of every $H$-orbit on $S$\ndivides $p^k$, and so $|S|\\equiv |T| \\pmod{p}$.\nOn the other hand, $H\\subset T$, and if $T$ contained an element not in $H$,\nthen that would contradict the maximality of $H$.  It follows that\n$H=T$, and so $|S|\\equiv |T| = |H| = p^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$,\ni.e., $|S|=n+1$ is a multiple of $p$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} This result is a theorem of Cauchy; the first solution\nabove is due to McKay. A more general (and more difficult) result was proved\nby Frobenius: for any positive integer $m$, if $G$ is a finite group of order\ndivisible by $m$, then the number of elements of $G$ of order dividing $m$\nis a multiple of $m$."
