      "content": "The largest possible radius is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nIt will be convenient to solve\nthe problem for a hypercube of side length 2 instead, in which case\nwe are trying to show that the largest radius is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nChoose coordinates so that the interior of the hypercube\nis the set $H = [-1,1]^4$ in $\\RR^4$. Let $C$ be a circle\ncentered at the point $P$. Then $C$ is contained both in $H$\nand its reflection across $P$; these intersect in a rectangular\nparalellepiped each of whose pairs of opposite faces are at most\n2 unit apart. Consequently, if we translate $C$ so that its center\nmoves to the point $O = (0,0,0,0)$ at the center of $H$,\nthen it remains entirely inside $H$.\n\nThis means that the answer we seek equals the largest possible radius\nof a circle $C$ contained in $H$ \\emph{and centered at $O$}.\nLet $v_1 = (v_{11}, \\dots, v_{14})$ and $v_2 = (v_{21},\\dots,v_{24})$\nbe two points on $C$ lying on radii perpendicular to each other.\nThen the points of the circle can be expressed as\n$v_1 \\cos \\theta + v_2 \\sin \\theta$ for $0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$.\nThen $C$ lies in $H$ if and only if for each $i$, we have\n\\[\n|v_{1i} \\cos \\theta + v_{2i} \\sin \\theta|\n\\leq 1 \\qquad (0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi).\n\\]\nIn geometric terms, the vector $(v_{1i}, v_{2i})$ in $\\RR^2$\nhas dot product at most 1 with every unit vector. Since this holds\nfor the unit vector in the same direction as\n$(v_{1i}, v_{2i})$, we must have\n\\[\nv_{1i}^2 + v_{2i}^2 \\leq 1 \\qquad (i=1,\\dots,4).\n\\]\nConversely, if this holds, then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nand the above analysis imply that $C$ lies in $H$.\n\nIf $r$ is the radius of $C$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n2 r^2 &= \\sum_{i=1}^4 v_{1i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^4 v_{2i}^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^4 (v_{1i}^2 + v_{2i}^2) \\\\\n&\\leq 4,\n\\end{align*}\nso $r \\leq \\sqrt{2}$.\nSince this is achieved by the circle\nthrough $(1,1,0,0)$ and $(0,0,1,1)$,\nit is the desired maximum.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nOne may similarly ask for the radius of the largest $k$-dimensional\nball inside an $n$-dimensional unit hypercube; the given problem is\nthe case $(n,k) = (4,2)$.\nDaniel Kane gives the following argument to show that the maximum radius\nin this case is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}}$.\n(Thanks for Noam Elkies for passing this along.)\n\nWe again scale up by a factor of 2, so that we are trying to show that\nthe maximum radius $r$ of a $k$-dimensional ball contained in the hypercube\n$[-1,1]^n$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}}$. Again, there is no loss of generality\nin centering the ball at the origin. Let $T: \\RR^k \\to \\RR^n$ be a\nsimilitude carrying the unit ball to this embedded $k$-ball.\nThen there exists a vector $v_i \\in \\RR^k$ such that\nfor $e_1,\\dots,e_n$ the standard basis of $\\RR^n$,\n$x \\cdot v_i = T(x) \\cdot e_i$ for all $x \\in \\RR^k$.\nThe condition of the problem is equivalent to requiring\n$|v_i| \\leq 1$ for all $i$, while the radius $r$ of the embedded ball\nis determined by the fact that for all $x \\in \\RR^k$,\n\\[\nr^2 (x \\cdot x) = T(x) \\cdot T(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x \\cdot v_i.\n\\]\nLet $M$ be the matrix with columns $v_1,\\dots,v_k$; then $MM^T = r^2 I_k$,\nfor $I_k$ the $k \\times k$ identity matrix. We then have\n\\begin{align*}\nkr^2 &= \\Trace(r^2 I_k) = \\Trace(MM^T)\\\\\n&= \\Trace(M^TM) = \\sum_{i=1}^n |v_i|^2 \\\\\n&\\leq n,\n\\end{align*}\nyielding the upper bound $r \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{k}}$.\n\nTo show that this bound is optimal, it is enough to show that one can\nfind an orthogonal projection of $\\RR^n$ onto $\\RR^k$ so that the\nprojections of the $e_i$ all have the same norm (one can then rescale\nto get the desired configuration of  $v_1,\\dots,v_n$). We construct\nsuch a configuration by a ``smoothing'' argument. Startw with any\nprojection.\nLet $w_1,\\dots,w_n$ be the projections of $e_1,\\dots,e_n$.\nIf the desired condition is not\nachieved, we can choose $i,j$ such that\n\\[\n|w_i|^2 < \\frac{1}{n} (|w_1|^2 + \\cdots + |w_n|^2) < |w_j|^2.\n\\]\nBy precomposing\nwith a suitable rotation that fixes $e_h$ for $h \\neq i,j$,\nwe can vary $|w_i|, |w_j|$ without varying $|w_i|^2 + |w_j|^2$\nor $|w_h|$ for $h \\neq i,j$. We can thus choose such a rotation to\nforce one of $|w_i|^2, |w_j|^2$ to become equal to\n$\\frac{1}{n} (|w_1|^2 + \\cdots + |w_n|^2)$.\nRepeating at most $n-1$ times gives the desired configuration."
