First note that for all $x>-1$,\n$e^x \\geq 1+x$ and thus\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:log}\nx \\geq \\log(1+x).\n\\end{equation}\nWe next claim that $a_n > \\log(n+1)$ (and in particular that $a_n-\\log\nn > 0$) for all $n$, by induction on $n$. For $n=0$ this follows\nfrom $a_0=1$. Now suppose that $a_n > \\log(n+1)$, and define $f(x)\n= x+e^{-x}$, which is an increasing function in $x>0$; then\n\\begin{align*}\na_{n+1} &= f(a_n) > f(\\log(n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\log(n+1) + 1/(n+1) \\geq \\log(n+2),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the last inequality is \\eqref{eq:log} with $x=1/(n+1)$. This completes\nthe induction step.\n\nIt follows that $a_n-\\log n$ is a decreasing function in $n$: we have\n\\begin{align*}\n&(a_{n+1} - \\log(n+1)) - (a_n - \\log n) \\\\\n&\\,= e^{-a_n} + \\log(n/(n+1)) \\\\\n&\\,< 1/(n+1) + \\log(n/(n+1)) \\leq 0,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the final inequality is \\eqref{eq:log} with $x = -1/(n+1)$. Thus\n$\\{a_n-\\log n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ is a decreasing sequence of positive numbers,\nand so it has a limit as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\nPut $b_n = e^{a_n}$, so that $b_{n+1} = b_n e^{1/b_n}$.  In terms of the\n$b_n$, the problem is to prove that $b_n/n$ has a limit as $n \\to \\infty$;\nwe will show that the limit is in fact equal to 1.\n\nExpanding $e^{1/b_n}$ as a Taylor series in $1/b_n$, we have\n\\[\nb_{n+1} = b_n + 1 + R_n\n\\]\nwhere $0 \\leq R_n \\leq c/b_n$ for some absolute constant $c>0$.\nBy writing\n\\[\nb_n = n+e + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} R_i,\n\\]\nwe see first that $b_n \\geq n+e$. We then see that\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &\\leq \\frac{b_n}{n} - 1 \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{e}{n} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{R_i}{n}  \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{e}{n} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c}{n b_i}  \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{e}{n} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c}{n (i+e)}  \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{e}{n} + \\frac{c \\log n}{n}.\n\\end{align*}\nIt follows that $b_n/n \\to 1$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThis problem is an example of the general principle that one can often predict the asymptotic behavior of a recursive\nsequence by studying solutions of a sufficiently similar-looking differential equation. In this case, we\nstart with the equation $a_{n+1} - a_n = e^{-a_n}$, then replace $a_n$ with a function $y(x)$\nand replace the difference $a_{n+1} - a_n$ with the derivative $y'(x)$ to obtain the differential equation\n$y' = e^{-y}$, which indeed has the solution $y = \\log x$."
