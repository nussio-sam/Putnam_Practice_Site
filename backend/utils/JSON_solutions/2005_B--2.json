      "content": "By the arithmetic-harmonic mean inequality or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,\n\\[\n(k_1 + \\cdots + k_n)\\left(\\frac{1}{k_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{k_n} \\right)\n\\geq n^2.\n\\]\nWe must thus have $5n-4 \\geq n^2$, so $n \\leq 4$. Without loss of generality,\nwe may suppose that $k_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq k_n$.\n\nIf $n=1$, we must have $k_1 = 1$, which works. Note that hereafter we cannot\nhave $k_1 =1$.\n\nIf $n = 2$, we have $(k_1,k_2) \\in \\{(2,4), (3,3)\\}$, neither of which work.\n\nIf $n=3$, we have $k_1 +k_2 +k_3 =11$, so $2 \\leq k_1 \\leq 3$.\nHence\n\\[\n(k_1,k_2,k_3) \\in \\{(2,2,7),(2,3,6),(2,4,5),(3,3,5),(3,4,4)\\},\n\\]\nand only $(2,3,6)$ works.\n\nIf $n = 4$, we must have equality in the AM-HM inequality, which only\nhappens when $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = 4$.\n\nHence the solutions are $n = 1$ and $k_1 = 1$,\n$n=3$ and $(k_1,k_2,k_3)$ is a permutation of $(2,3,6)$,\nand $n=4$ and $(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4) = (4,4,4,4)$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIn the cases $n=2,3$, Greg Kuperberg suggests the alternate\napproach of\nenumerating the\nsolutions of $1/k_1 + \\cdots + 1/k_n = 1$ with $k_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq k_n$.\nThis is easily done by\nproceeding in lexicographic order: one obtains $(2,2)$ for $n=2$, and\n$(2,3,6), (2,4,4), (3,3,3)$ for $n=3$, and only $(2,3,6)$ contributes\nto the final answer."
