      "content": "Let $g(x) = e^{x/2} f(x)$. Then $g$ has at least $5$ distinct real zeroes,\nand by repeated applications of Rolle's theorem, $g', g'', g'''$ have at least $4,3,2$ distinct real zeroes, respectively. But\n\\[\ng'''(x) = \\frac{1}{8} e^{x/2} (f(x) + 6 f'(x) + 12 f''(x) + 8 f'''(x))\n\\]\nand $e^{x/2}$ is never zero, so we obtain the desired result."
