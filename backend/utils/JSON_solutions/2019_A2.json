Since $C,G,M$ are collinear with $CM = 3GM$, the distance from $C$ to line $AB$ is $3$ times the distance from $G$ to $AB$, and the latter is $r$ since $IG \\parallel AB$; hence the altitude $CD$ has length $3r$. By the double angle formula for tangent, $\\frac{CD}{DB} = \\tan\\beta = \\frac{3}{4}$, and so $DB = 4r$. Let $E$ be the point where the incircle meets $AB$; then $EB = r/\\tan(\\frac{\\beta}{2}) = 3r$. It follows that $ED = r$, whence the incircle is tangent to the altitude $CD$. This implies that $D=A$, $ABC$ is a right triangle, and $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nOne can obtain a similar solution by fixing a coordinate system with $B$ at the origin and $A$ on the positive \n$x$-axis. Since $\\tan \\frac{\\beta}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$, we may assume without loss of generality that\n$I = (3,1)$. Then $C$ lies on the intersection of the line $y=3$ (because $CD = 3r$ as above) \nwith the line $y = \\frac{3}{4} x$ (because $\\tan \\beta = \\frac{3}{4}$ as above), forcing $C = (4,3)$ and so forth.\n\n\\noindent \\textbf{Solution 2.}\nLet $a,b,c$ be the lengths of $BC,CA,AB$, respectively.\nLet $r$, $s$, and $K$ denote the inradius, semiperimeter, and area of $\\triangle ABC$. \nBy Heron's Formula,\n\\[\nr^2s^2 = K^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c).\n\\]\n\nIf $IG$ is parallel to $AB$, then \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} rc = \n\\mathrm{area}(\\triangle ABI) = \\mathrm{area}(\\triangle ABG) = \\frac{1}{3} K = \\frac{1}{3} rs\n\\]\nand so $c = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Since $s = \\frac{3(a+b)}{4}$ and $s-c = \\frac{a+b}{4}$, we have \n$3r^2 = (s-a)(s-b)$. Let $E$ be the point at which the incircle meets $AB$; then $s-b = EB = r/\\tan(\\frac{\\beta}{2})$ and $s-a = EA = r/\\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$. It follows that $\\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\tan(\\frac{\\beta}{2}) = \\frac{1}{3}$ and so $\\tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) = 1$. This implies that $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe equality $c = \\frac{a+b}{2}$ can also be derived from the vector representations\n\\[\nG = \\frac{A+B+C}{3}, \\qquad I = \\frac{aA+bB+cC}{a+b+c}.\n\\]\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Solution 3.}\n(by Catalin Zara)\nIt is straightforward to check that a right triangle with $AC = 3, AB = 4, BC = 5$ works. For example,\nin a coordinate system with $A = (0,0), B = (4,0), C = (0,3)$, we have\n\\[\nG = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}, 1 \\right), \\qquad \nI = (1, 1)\n\\]\nand for $D = (1,0)$, \n\\[\n\\tan \\frac{\\beta}{2} = \\frac{ID}{BD} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\nIt thus suffices to suggest that this example is unique up to similarity.\n\nLet $C'$ be the foot of the angle bisector at $C$. Then \n\\[\n\\frac{CI}{IC'} = \\frac{CA + CB}{AB}\n\\] \nand so $IG$ is parallel to $AB$ if and only if $CA + CB = 2AB$. We may assume without loss of generality that $A$ and $B$ are fixed, in which case this condition restricts $C$ to an ellipse with foci at $A$ and $B$.\nSince the angle $\\beta$ is also fixed, up to symmetry \n$C$ is further restricted to a half-line starting at $B$; this intersects the ellipse in a unique point.\n\n\\noindent \n\\textbf{Remark.}\nGiven that $CA + CB = 2AB$, one can also recover the ratio of side lengths using the law of cosines."
