Then the only\nway they can fail to form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral is if one\nof them lies inside the triangle formed by the other three. There are four\nsuch configurations, depending on which point lies inside the triangle, and\nthey are mutually exclusive. Hence the desired probability is 1 minus\nfour times the probability that $S$ lies inside triangle $PQR$. That latter\nprobability is simply $E([PQR])$ divided by the area of\nthe disc.\n\nLet $O$ denote the center of the circle,\nand let $P',Q',R'$ be the projections of $P,Q,R$ onto the circle from $O$.\nWe can write\n\\[\n[PQR] = \\pm [OPQ] \\pm [OQR] \\pm [ORP]\n\\]\nfor a suitable choice of signs, determined as follows. If the points\n$P',Q',R'$ lie on no semicircle, then all of the signs are positive.\nIf $P',Q',R'$ lie on a semicircle in that order and\n$Q$ lies inside the triangle $OPR$, then the sign on $[OPR]$ is\npositive and the others are negative.\nIf $P',Q',R'$ lie on a semicircle in that order and\n$Q$ lies outside the triangle $OPR$, then the sign on $[OPR]$ is\nnegative and the others are positive.\n\nWe first calculate\n\\[\nE([OPQ] + [OQR] + [ORP]) = 3 E([OPQ]).\n\\]\nWrite $r_1 = OP, r_2 = OQ, \\theta = \\angle POQ$, so that\n\\[\n[OPQ] = \\frac{1}{2} r_1 r_2 (\\sin \\theta).\n\\]\nThe distribution of $r_1$ is given by $2r_1$ on $[0,1]$\n(e.g., by the change of variable formula to polar coordinates),\nand similarly for $r_2$.\nThe distribution of $\\theta$ is uniform on $[0,\\pi]$.\nThese three distributions are independent; hence\n\\begin{align*}\n& E([OPQ]) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\int_0^{1} 2r^2\\,dr \\right)^2\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin (\\theta)\\,d\\theta \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{9 \\pi},\n\\end{align*}\nand\n\\[\nE([OPQ] + [OQR] + [ORP]) = \\frac{4}{3 \\pi}.\n\\]\n\nWe now treat the case where $P',Q',R'$ lie on a semicircle in\nthat order.\nPut $\\theta_1 = \\angle POQ$ and $\\theta_2 = \\angle QOR$; then\nthe distribution of $\\theta_1, \\theta_2$ is uniform on the region\n\\[\n0 \\leq \\theta_1, \\quad 0 \\leq \\theta_2, \\quad \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 \\leq \\pi.\n\\]\nIn particular, the distribution on $\\theta = \\theta_1 + \\theta_2$\nis $\\frac{2\\theta}{\\pi^2}$ on $[0, \\pi]$.\nPut $r_P = OP, r_Q = OQ, r_R = OR$. Again, the distribution on $r_P$\nis given by $2 r_P$ on $[0,1]$, and similarly for $r_Q, r_R$; these\nare independent from each other and from the joint distribution\nof $\\theta_1,\\theta_2$.\nWrite $E'(X)$ for the expectation of a random variable $X$\nrestricted to this part of the domain.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be the random variable with value 1 if $Q$ is inside\ntriangle $OPR$ and 0 otherwise.\nWe now compute\n\\begin{align*}\n&E'([OPR]) \\\\\n&=\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\int_0^1 2r^2\\,dr \\right)^2\n\\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{2\\theta}{\\pi^2} \\sin(\\theta) \\,d\\theta \\right)\\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{9 \\pi} \\\\\n& E'(\\chi [OPR]) \\\\\n&= E'(2 [OPR]^2 / \\theta) \\\\\n&=\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\int_0^1 2r^3\\,dr \\right)^2\n\\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{2\\theta}{\\pi^2} \\theta^{-1} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\,d\\theta \\right)\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{8\\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\nAlso recall that given any triangle $XYZ$, if $T$ is chosen uniformly\nat random inside $XYZ$, the expectation of $[TXY]$ is the area of\ntriangle bounded by $XY$ and the centroid of $XYZ$, namely\n$\\frac{1}{3} [XYZ]$.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be the random variable with value 1 if $Q$ is inside\ntriangle $OPR$ and 0 otherwise. Then\n\\begin{align*}\n&E'([OPQ] + [OQR] + [ORP] - [PQR]) \\\\\n&= 2 E'(\\chi ([OPQ] + [OQR]) + 2 E'((1-\\chi)[OPR]) \\\\\n&= 2 E'(\\frac{2}{3} \\chi [OPR]) + 2 E'([OPR]) - 2 E'(\\chi [OPR]) \\\\\n&= 2E'([OPR]) - \\frac{2}{3} E'(\\chi [OPR]) = \\frac{29}{36 \\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinally, note that the case when $P',Q',R'$\nlie on a semicircle in some order occurs with probability $3/4$.\n(The case where they lie on a semicircle proceeding clockwise from $P'$\nto its antipode has probability 1/4; this case and its two analogues are\nexclusive and exhaustive.) Hence\n\\begin{align*}\n&E([PQR]) \\\\\n&= E([OPQ]+[OQR]+[ORP]) \\\\\n&\\quad - \\frac{3}{4} E'([OPQ] + [OQR] + [ORP] - [PQR]) \\\\\n&= \\frac{4}{3 \\pi} - \\frac{29}{48 \\pi} = \\frac{35}{48 \\pi},\n\\end{align*}\nso the original probability is\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{4 E([PQR])}{\\pi} = 1 - \\frac{35}{12 \\pi^2}.\n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by David Savitt)\nAs in the first solution, it suffices to check that for\n$P,Q,R$ chosen uniformly at random in the disc, $E([PQR]) = \\frac{35}{48 \\pi}$.\nDraw the lines $PQ, QR, RP$, which with probability 1 divide the interior\nof the circle into seven regions. Put $a = [PQR]$, let $b_1,b_2,b_3$\ndenote the areas of the\nthree other regions sharing a side with the triangle, and let\n$c_1,c_2,c_3$ denote the areas of the other three regions.\nPut $A = E(a)$, $B = E(b_1)$, $C = E(c_1)$, so that\n$A + 3B + 3C = \\pi$.\n\nNote that $c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + a$ is the area of the region in which we can\nchoose a fourth point $S$ so that the quadrilateral $PQRS$ fails to be\nconvex. By comparing expectations, we have $3C + A = 4A$,\nso $A = C$ and $4A + 3B = \\pi$.\n\nWe will compute $B + 2A = B + 2C$, which is the expected area of the part\nof the circle cut off by a chord through two random points $D,E$, on the\nside of the chord not containing a third random point $F$.\nLet $h$ be the distance from the center $O$ of the circle to the line $DE$.\nWe now determine the distribution of $h$.\n\nPut $r = OD$; the distribution of $r$ is $2r$ on $[0,1]$.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $O$ is the origin and\n$D$ lies on the positive $x$-axis.\nFor fixed $r$, the distribution of $h$ runs over $[0,r]$,\nand can be computed as the area of the infinitesimal region in which\n$E$ can be chosen so the chord through $DE$ has distance to $O$\nbetween $h$ and $h+dh$, divided by $\\pi$.\nThis region splits into two symmetric pieces, one of which lies\nbetween chords making angles of $\\arcsin(h/r)$ and\n$\\arcsin((h + dh)/r)$ with the $x$-axis.\nThe angle between these is $d\\theta = dh/(r^2 - h^2)$.\nDraw the chord through $D$ at distance $h$ to $O$, and let $L_1,L_2$ be the\nlengths of the parts on opposite sides of $D$; then\nthe area we are looking for is $\\frac{1}{2}(L_1^2 + L_2^2) d\\theta$.\nSince\n\\[\n\\{L_1, L_2 \\} = \\sqrt{1-h^2} \\pm \\sqrt{r^2 - h^2},\n\\]\nthe area we are seeking (after doubling) is\n\\[\n2\\frac{1 + r^2 - 2h^2}{\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}}.\n\\]\nDividing by $\\pi$, then integrating over $r$, we compute the distribution\nof $h$ to be\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_h^1 2 \\frac{1 + r^2 - 2h^2}{\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}} 2r\\,dr \\\\\n&= \\frac{16}{3\\pi} (1-h^2)^{3/2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe now return to computing $B +2A$.\nLet $A(h)$ denote the smaller of the two areas of the disc cut off\nby a chord at distance $h$.\nThe chance that the third point is in the smaller (resp.\\\nlarger) portion is $A(h)/\\pi$ (resp.\\ $1 - A(h)/\\pi$),\nand then the area we are trying to compute is $\\pi - A(h)$\n(resp.\\ $A(h)$).\nUsing the distribution on $h$,\nand the fact that\n\\begin{align*}\nA(h) &= 2 \\int_h^1 \\sqrt{1-h^2}\\,dh \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{2}  - \\arcsin(h) - h \\sqrt{1-h^2},\n\\end{align*}\nwe find\n\\begin{align*}\n&B+2A \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^1 A(h) (\\pi - A(h))\\, \\frac{16}{3\\pi} (1-h^2)^{3/2}\n\\,dh \\\\\n&= \\frac{35 + 24 \\pi^2}{72 \\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $4A + 3B = \\pi$, we solve to obtain\n$A = \\frac{35}{48 \\pi}$ as in the first solution.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:} (by Noam Elkies)\nAgain, we reduce to computing the average area of a triangle formed by\nthree random points $A,B,C$ inside a unit circle.\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle, and put $c = \\max\\{OA,OB,OC\\}$;\nthen the probability that $c \\leq r$ is $(r^2)^3$, so the distribution\nof $c$ is $6c^5\\,dc$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nGiven $c$, the expectation of $[ABC]$ is equal to $c^2$ times $X$, the expected\narea of a triangle formed by two random points $P,Q$ in a circle and\na fixed point $R$ on the boundary. We introduce polar coordinates centered\nat $R$, in which the circle is given by $r = 2 \\sin \\theta$ for\n$\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. The distribution of a random point in that circle is\n$\\frac{1}{\\pi} r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ over $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$ and\n$r \\in [0, 2 \\sin \\theta]$. If $(r,\\theta)$ and $(r',\\theta')$ are the\ntwo random points, then the area is $\\frac{1}{2} rr' \\sin |\\theta - \\theta'|$.\n\nPerforming the integrals over $r$ and $r'$ first, we find\n\\begin{align*}\nX &= \\frac{32}{9 \\pi^2} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3 \\theta \\sin^3 \\theta'\n\\sin |\\theta-\\theta'|\\,d\\theta'\\,d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{64}{9 \\pi^2} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\theta \\sin^3 \\theta \\sin^3 \\theta'\n\\sin (\\theta-\\theta') \\,d\\theta'\\,d\\theta.\n\\end{align*}\nThis integral is unpleasant but straightforward; it yields\n$X = 35/(36 \\pi)$, and\n$E([PQR]) = \\int_0^1 6c^7 X\\,dc = 35/(48 \\pi)$, giving the desired\nresult.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThis is one of the oldest problems in geometric probability; it is an instance\nof Sylvester's four-point problem, which nowadays is usually solved using\na device known as Crofton's formula.\nWe defer to \\texttt{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/} for\nfurther discussion."
