      "content": "Yes, such numbers must exist. To define them, we make the following observations.\n\n\\setcounter{lemma}{0}\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor any $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, if there exists any $S \\in P$ containing $i$, then there exist $S,T \\in P$ such that $S$ is the disjoint union of $T$ with $\\{i\\}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $S$ be an element of $P$ containing $i$ of minimum cardinality.\nBy (ii), there must be a subset $T \\subset S$ containing $P$ with exactly one fewer element than $S$. These sets have the desired form.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nSuppose $S_1, S_2, T_1, T_2 \\in P$ have the property that for some $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, $S_1$ is the disjoint union of $T_1$ with $\\{i\\}$ and $S_2$ is the disjoint union of $T_2$ with $\\{i\\}$. Then \n\\[\nf(S_1) - f(T_1) = f(S_2) - f(T_2).\n\\]\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nBy (i) we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup \\{i\\}) &= f(S_1) + f(T_2) - f(T_1 \\cap T_2) \\\\\nf(T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup \\{i\\}) &= f(T_1) + f(S_2) - f(T_1 \\cap T_2),\n\\end{align*}\nfrom which the claim follows immediately.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe now define $f_1,\\dots,f_n$ as follows. If $i$ does not appear in any element of $P$, we put $f_i = 0$. Otherwise, by Lemma~1, we can find \n$S, T \\in P$ such that $S$ is the disjoint union of $T$ with $\\{i\\}$. We then set $f_i = f(S) - f(T)$; by Lemma~2, this does not depend on the choice of $S,T$.\n\nTo check that $f(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} f_i$ for $S \\in P$, note first that $\\emptyset \\in P$ by repeated application of (ii) and that $f(\\emptyset) = 0$ by hypothesis. This provides the base case for an induction on the cardinality of $S$; for any nonempty $S \\in P$, we may apply (ii) to find $T \\subset S$ such that $S$ is the disjoint union of $T$ and some singleton set $\\{j\\}$. By construction and the induction hypothesis, we have $f(S) = f(T) + f_j = j + \\sum_{i \\in T} f_i = \\sum_{i \\in S} f_i$ as desired."
