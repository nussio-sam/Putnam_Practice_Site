      "content": "Note that $n$ is a repunit if and only if $9n+1 = 10^m$ for some power of\n10 greater than 1. Consequently, if we put\n\\[\ng(n) = 9f\\left( \\frac{n-1}{9} \\right) + 1,\n\\]\nthen $f$ takes repunits to repunits if and only if $g$ takes powers of 10\ngreater than 1 to powers of 10 greater than 1. We will show that the only\nsuch functions $g$ are those of the form $g(n) = 10^c n^d$ for $d \\geq 0$,\n$c \\geq 1-d$ (all of which clearly work),\nwhich will mean that the desired polynomials $f$ are those of the form\n\\[\nf(n) = \\frac{1}{9}(10^c (9n+1)^d - 1)\n\\]\nfor the same $c,d$.\n\nIt is convenient to allow ``powers of 10'' to be of the form\n$10^k$ for any integer $k$. With this convention, it suffices to check that\nthe polynomials $g$ taking powers of 10 greater than 1 to powers of 10\nare of the form $10^c n^d$ for any integers $c,d$ with $d \\geq 0$.\n\n\\textbf{First solution:}\nSuppose that the leading term of $g(x)$ is $ax^d$, and note that\n$a>0$. As $x \\to \\infty$, we have $g(x)/x^d \\to a$; however, for $x$\na power of 10 greater than 1, $g(x)/x^d$ is a power of 10.\nThe set of powers of 10 has no positive limit point, so $g(x)/x^d$\nmust be equal to $a$ for $x = 10^k$ with $k$ sufficiently large,\nand we must have $a = 10^c$ for some $c$.\nThe polynomial $g(x) - 10^c x^d$ has infinitely many roots, so\nmust be identically zero.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nWe proceed by induction on $d = \\deg(g)$.\nIf $d=0$, we have $g(n) = 10^c$ for some $c$. Otherwise,\n$g$ has rational coefficients by Lagrange's interpolation formula (this\napplies to any polynomial of degree $d$ taking at least $d+1$\ndifferent rational numbers to rational numbers), so $g(0) = t$ is rational.\nMoreover, $g$ takes each value only finitely many times, so the sequence\n$g(10^0), g(10^1), \\dots$ includes arbitrarily large powers of 10.\nSuppose that $t \\neq 0$; then we can choose a positive integer $h$ such that\nthe numerator of $t$ is not divisible by $10^h$.\nBut for $c$ large enough, $g(10^c) - t$ has numerator divisible by\n$10^b$ for some $b>h$, contradiction.\n\nConsequently, $t=0$, and we may apply the induction hypothesis to $g(n)/n$\nto deduce the claim.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} The second solution amounts to the fact that $g$, being\na polynomial with rational coefficients, is continuous for the $2$-adic\nand $5$-adic topologies on $\\mathbb{Q}$. By contrast, the first solution\nuses the ``$\\infty$-adic'' topology, i.e., the usual real topology."
