Then\n\\begin{align*}\nF_a(x)e^{-t} &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^a e^{2n-t} x^{n^2}  \\\\\n&\\geq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^a e^{2n-t-n^2/t-n^2/t^2}  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^a e^{-n^2/t^2} e^{-t(1-n/t)^2}.\n\\end{align*}\nIf we restrict the sum to the range $t < n < t + \\sqrt{t}$, we may bound the summand from below by\n$c t^a$; we then have\n$F_a(x) e^{-t} > ct^{a+1/2}$ and this tends to $\\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nSuppose next that $a < -\\frac{1}{2}$. Then\n\\begin{align*}\nF_a(x)e^{-t} &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^a e^{2n-t} x^{n^2} \\\\\n&\\leq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^a e^{-t(1-n/t)^2}.\n\\end{align*}\nFix $\\epsilon>0$ such that $a+\\epsilon < -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor the summands with $t - t^{1/2+\\epsilon} < n < t + t^{1/2+\\epsilon}$, we may bound the summand from above by $ct^a$; this range of the sum is then dominated by\n$ct^{a+1/2+\\epsilon}$. \nFor the summands with $n < t - t^{1/2+\\epsilon}$, we may bound the summand by\n$n^a e^{-t^{2\\epsilon}}$; this range of the sum is then dominated by $t e^{-t^{2\\epsilon}}$.\nFor the summands with $n > t - t^{1/2+\\epsilon}$, we may again bound the summand by\n$n^a e^{-t^{2\\epsilon}}$; this range of the sum is then dominated by $c t^{a+1} e^{-t^{2\\epsilon}}$.\nSince all three bounds tends to 0 as $t \\to \\infty$, so then does $F_a(x) e^{-t}$."
