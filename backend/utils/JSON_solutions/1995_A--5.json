      "content": "Everyone (presumably) knows that the set of solutions of a system of\nlinear first-order differential equations with constant coefficients\nis $n$-dimensional, with basis vectors of the form $f_{i}(t)\n\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e.\\ a function times a constant vector), where the\n$\\vec{v}_{i}$ are linearly independent. In\nparticular, our solution $\\vec{x}(t)$ can be written as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\nc_{i}f_{i}(t) \\vec{v}_{1}$.\n\nChoose a vector $\\vec{w}$ orthogonal to $\\vec{v}_{2}, \\dots,\n\\vec{v}_{n}$ but not to $\\vec{v}_1$. Since $\\vec{x}(t) \\to 0$ as $t\n\\to \\infty$, the same is true of $\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x}$; but that is\nsimply $(\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{v}_{1}) c_{1} f_{1}(t)$. In other words,\nif $c_{i} \\neq 0$, then $f_{i}(t)$ must also go to 0.\n\nHowever, it is easy to exhibit a solution which does not go to 0. The\nsum of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A = (a_{ij})$, also known as the\ntrace of $A$, being the sum of the diagonal entries of $A$, is\nnonnegative, so $A$ has an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ with nonnegative real\npart, and a corresponding eigenvector $\\vec{v}$. Then $e^{\\lambda t}\n\\vec{v}$ is a solution that does not go to 0. (If $\\lambda$ is not\nreal, add this solution to its complex conjugate to get a real\nsolution, which still doesn't go to 0.)\n\nHence one of the $c_{i}$, say $c_{1}$, is zero, in which case\n$\\vec{x}(t) \\cdot \\vec{w} = 0$ for all $t$."
