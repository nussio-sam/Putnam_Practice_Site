      "content": "The answer is $n$ odd. Let $I$ denote the $n\\times n$ identity\nmatrix, and let $A$ denote the $n\\times n$ matrix all of whose entries\nare $1$. If $n$ is odd, then the matrix $A-I$ satisfies the conditions of\nthe problem: the dot product of any row with itself is $n-1$, and the dot\nproduct of any two distinct rows is $n-2$.\n\nConversely, suppose $n$ is even, and suppose that the matrix $M$ satisfied\nthe conditions of the problem. Consider all matrices and vectors mod\n$2$. Since the dot product of a row with itself is equal mod $2$ to the\nsum of the entries of the row, we have $M v = 0$ where $v$ is the vector\n$(1,1,\\ldots,1)$, and so $M$ is singular. On the other hand, $M M^T =\nA-I$; since\n\\[\n(A-I)^2 = A^2-2A+I = (n-2)A+I = I,\n\\]\nwe have $(\\det M)^2 = \\det(A-I) = 1$ and $\\det M = 1$, contradicting the\nfact that $M$ is singular."
