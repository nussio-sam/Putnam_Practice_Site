Since $Q$ is homogeneous, $P$ is divisible\nby $Q$ if and only if each of the homogeneous components of $P$ is divisible\nby $Q$. It is thus sufficient to solve the problem in case $P$ itself is\nhomogeneous, say of degree $d$.\n\nSuppose that we have a factorization $P = Q^m R$ for some $m>0$, where\n$R$ is homogeneous\nof degree $d$ and not divisible by $Q$;\nnote that the homogeneity implies that\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial x_i} = dR.\n\\]\nWrite $\\nabla^2$ as shorthand for $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\nx_1^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_n^2}$; then\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\nabla^2 P \\\\\n&= 2mn Q^{m-1}R + Q^m \\nabla^2 R + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n 2mx_i Q^{m-1}\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial\nx_i} \\\\\n&= Q^m \\nabla^2 R + (2mn + 4md) Q^{m-1} R.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $m>0$, this forces $R$ to be divisible by $Q$, contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by Noam Elkies)\nRetain notation as in the first solution.\nLet $P_d$ be the set of homogeneous\npolynomials of degree $d$, and let $H_d$ be the subset of $P_d$\nof polynomials killed by $\\nabla^2$, which has dimension\n$\\geq \\dim(P_d) - \\dim(P_{d-2})$; the given problem amounts to showing\nthat this inequality is actually an equality.\n\nConsider the operator $Q \\nabla^2$ (i.e., apply $\\nabla^2$ then multiply\nby $Q$) on $P_d$; its zero eigenspace is precisely $H_d$.\nBy the calculation from the first solution, if $R \\in P_d$, then\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 (QR) - Q \\nabla^2 R = (2n+4d)R.\n\\]\nConsequently, $Q^j H_{d-2j}$ is contained in the eigenspace of $Q \\nabla^2$\non $P_d$ of eigenvalue\n\\[\n(2n+4(d-2j)) + \\cdots + (2n+4(d-2)).\n\\]\nIn particular, the $Q^j H^{d-2j}$ lie in distinct eigenspaces, so are\nlinearly independent within $P_d$. But by dimension counting,\ntheir total dimension is at least that of $P_d$.\nHence they exhaust $P_d$, and the zero eigenspace cannot have dimension\ngreater than $\\dim(P_d) - \\dim(P_{d-2})$, as desired.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\n(by Richard Stanley)\nWrite $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and $\\nabla = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1},\n\\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_n})$.\nSuppose that $P(x) = Q(x)(x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2)$. Then\n\\[\nP(\\nabla)P(x) = Q(\\nabla)(\\nabla^2)P(x) =0.\n\\]\nOn the other hand,\nif $P(x) = \\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha x^\\alpha$ (where $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1,\n\\dots, \\alpha_n)$ and $x^\\alpha = x_1^{\\alpha_1} \\cdots\nx_n^{\\alpha_n}$), then the constant term of $P(\\nabla)P(x)$\nis seen to be $\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha^2$. Hence $c_\\alpha = 0$ for all\n$\\alpha$.\n\n\\textbf{Remarks:}\nThe first two solutions apply directly over any field of characteristic zero.\n(The result fails in characteristic $p>0$ because we may take\n$P = (x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2)^p = x_1^{2p} + \\cdots + x_n^{2p}$.)\nThe third solution can be extended to complex coefficients\nby replacing $P(\\nabla)$ by its complex conjugate, and again the result\nmay be deduced for any field of characteristic zero.\nStanley also suggests\nSection 5 of the arXiv e-print \\texttt{math.CO/0502363} for\nsome  algebraic background for this problem."
