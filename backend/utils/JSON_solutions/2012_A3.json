      "content": "We will prove that $f(x) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ for all $x \\in [-1,1]$. Define\n$g :\\thinspace (-1,1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by\n$g(x) = f(x)/\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Plugging $f(x) = g(x)\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ into\nequation (i) and simplifying yields\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:g}\ng(x) = g\\left(\\frac{x^2}{2-x^2}\\right)\n\\end{equation}\n  for all $x \\in (-1,1)$. Now fix $x \\in (-1,1)$ and define a sequence\n$\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ by $a_1=x$ and $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n^2}{2-a_n^2}$.\nThen\n  $a_n \\in (-1,1)$ and thus $|a_{n+1}| \\leq |a_n|^2$ for all $n$. It\nfollows that $\\{|a_n|\\}$ is a decreasing sequence with $|a_n| \\leq\n|x|^n$ for all $n$, and so $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = 0$. Since $g(a_n) =\ng(x)$ for all $n$ by \\eqref{eq:g} and $g$ is continuous at $0$, we\nconclude that $g(x) = g(0) = f(0) = 1$. This holds for all $x \\in\n(-1,1)$ and thus for $x=\\pm 1$ as well by continuity. The result follows.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.} As pointed out by Noam Elkies, condition (iii) is unnecessary.\nHowever, one can use it to derive a slightly different solution by running the recursion\nin the opposite direction."
