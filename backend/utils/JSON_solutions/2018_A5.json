Given the claim for $n=m$,\nwe apply the induction hypothesis to $f' \\in S$ to see that\n\\[\nf'(t) \\leq \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(1)}{n!} t^n \\qquad (t \\in [0,1]),\n\\]\nthen integrate both sides from $0$ to $x$ to conclude.\n\nNow for $f \\in S$, we have $0 \\leq f(1) \\leq \\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}$ for all $n \\geq 0$. \nOn the other hand, by Taylor's theorem with remainder,\n\\[\nf(x) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{f^{(k)}(1)}{k!}(x-1)^k \\qquad (x \\geq 1).\n\\]\nApplying this with $x=2$, we obtain $f(2) \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{f^{(k)}(1)}{k!}$ for all $n$;\nthis implies that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}  \\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!} = 0$.\nSince $f(1) \\leq \\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}$, we must have $f(1) = 0$.\n\nFor $f \\in S$, we proved earlier that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\\leq 0$, as well as for $x=1$. Since\nthe function $g(x) = f(cx)$ is also ultraconvex for $c>0$, we also have $f(x) = 0$ for all $x>0$;\nhence $f$ is identically zero.\n\nTo sum up, if $f\\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is infinitely differentiable, $f(0)=0$, and $f(1) = 1$,\nthen $f$ cannot be ultraconvex. This implies the desired result.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Variant.}\n(by Yakov Berchenko-Kogan)\nAnother way to show that any $f \\in S$ is identically zero is to show that for $f \\in S$ and $k$ a positive integer,\n\\[\nf(x) \\leq \\frac{x}{k} f'(x) \\qquad (x \\geq 0).\n\\]\nWe prove this by induction on $k$.\nFor the base case $k=1$, note that $f''(x) \\geq 0$ implies that $f'$ is nondecreasing. For $x \\geq 0$, we thus have\n\\[\nf(x) = \\int_0^x f'(t)\\,dt \\leq \\int_0^x f'(x)\\,dt = x f'(x).\n\\]\nTo pass from $k$ to $k+1$, apply the induction hypothesis to $f'$ and integrate by parts to obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nkf(x) &= \\int_0^x k f'(t)\\,dt \\\\\n&\\leq \\int_0^x t f''(t)\\,dt \\\\\n&= xf'(x) - \\int_0^x f'(t)\\,dt = xf'(x) - f(x).\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nNoam Elkies points out that one can refine the argument to show that\nif $f$ is ultraconvex, then it is analytic (i.e., it is represented by an entire Taylor series about any point, as opposed to a function like $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ whose Taylor series at $0$ is identically zero);\nhe attributes the following argument to \nPeter Shalen. Let $g_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{1}{k!} f^{(k})(0) x^k$ be the $n$-th order Taylor polynomial of $f$.\nBy Taylor's theorem with remainder (a/k/a Lagrange's theorem), $f(x) - g_n(x)$ is everywhere nonnegative;\nconsequently, for all $x \\geq 0$, the Taylor series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n$\nconverges and is bounded above by $f$. But since $f^{(n+1)}(x)$ is nondecreasing, Lagrange's theorem \nalso implies that $f(x) - g_n(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{(n+1)!} f^{(n+1)}(x)$; for fixed $x \\geq 0$, the right side \ntends to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. Hence $f$ is represented by its Taylor series for $x \\geq 0$, and so\nis analytic for $x>0$; by replacing $f(x)$ with $f(x-c)$, we may conclude that $f$ is everywhere analytic.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nWe record some properties of the class of ultraconvex functions.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nAny nonnegative constant function is ultraconvex. The exponential function is ultraconvex.\n\\item\nIf $f$ is ultraconvex, then $f'$ is ultraconvex. Conversely, if $f'$ is ultraconvex and\n$\\liminf_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) \\geq 0$, then $f$ is ultraconvex.\n\\item\nThe class of ultraconvex functions is closed under addition, multiplication, and composition."
