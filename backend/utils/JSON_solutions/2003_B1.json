By setting $y=-1,0,1$ in succession, we see that\nthe polynomials $1-x+x^2, 1, 1+x+x^2$ are linear combinations of $a(x)$\nand $b(x)$.  But these three polynomials are linearly independent, so\ncannot all be written as linear combinations of two other polynomials,\ncontradiction.\n\nAlternate formulation: the given equation expresses a diagonal matrix with\n$1,1,1$ and zeroes on the diagonal, which has rank 3, as the sum of two\nmatrices of rank 1. But the rank of a sum of matrices is at most the sum\nof the ranks of the individual matrices.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nIt is equivalent (by relabeling and rescaling)\nto show that $1 + xy + x^2y^2$ cannot be written\nas $a(x) d(y) - b(x) c(y)$.\nWrite $a(x) = \\sum a_i x^i$,\n$b(x) = \\sum b_i x^i$, $c(y) = \\sum c_j y^j$,\n$d(y) = \\sum d_j y^j$. We now start comparing coefficients\nof $1 + xy + x^2 y^2$. By comparing coefficients of\n$1+xy + x^2y^2 $ and $a(x)d(y) - b(x)c(y)$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= a_id_i - b_i c_i \\qquad (i=0,1,2)\\\\\n0 &= a_id_j - b_i c_j \\qquad (i \\neq j).\n\\end{align*}\nThe first equation says that $a_i$ and $b_i$ cannot both vanish,\nand $c_i$ and $d_i$ cannot both vanish. The second equation says that\n$a_i/b_i = c_j/d_j$ when $i \\neq j$, where both sides should be viewed\nin $\\RR \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ (and neither is undetermined if\n$i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$). But then\n\\[\na_0/b_0 = c_1/d_1 = a_2/b_2 = c_0/d_0\n\\]\ncontradicting the equation $a_0d_0 - b_0c_0 = 1$.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\nWe work over the complex numbers, in which we have a primitive cube root\n$\\omega$ of 1. We also use without further comment unique factorization\nfor polynomials in two variables over a field.  And we keep the relabeling\nof the second solution.\n\nSuppose the contrary.  Since $1+xy+x^2y^2 = (1 - xy/\\omega)(1 -\nxy/\\omega^2)$, the rational function $a(\\omega/y) d(y) - b(\\omega/y) c(y)$\nmust vanish identically (that is, coefficient by coefficient).  If one of\nthe polynomials, say $a$, vanished identically, then one of $b$ or $c$\nwould also, and the desired inequality could not hold. So none of them\nvanish identically, and we can write\n\\[\n\\frac{c(y)}{d(y)} = \\frac{a(\\omega/y)}{b(\\omega/y)}.\n\\]\nLikewise,\n\\[\n\\frac{c(y)}{d(y)}= \\frac{a(\\omega^2/y)}{b(\\omega^2/y)}.\n\\]\nPut $f(x) = a(x)/b(x)$; then we have $f(\\omega x) = f(x)$ identically. That is,\n$a(x) b(\\omega x) = b(x) a(\\omega x)$. Since $a$ and $b$ have no common\nfactor (otherwise $1+xy+x^2y^2$ would have a factor divisible only by\n$x$, which it doesn't since it doesn't vanish identically for any particular\n$x$), $a(x)$ divides $a(\\omega x)$. Since they have the same degree, they\nare equal up to scalars. It follows that one of $a(x), xa(x), x^2a(x)$\nis a polynomial in $x^3$ alone, and likewise for $b$ (with the same\npower of $x$).\n\nIf $xa(x)$ and $xb(x)$, or $x^2 a(x)$ and $x^2 b(x)$, are polynomials in\n$x^3$, then $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $x$, but we know $a$ and $b$ have no\ncommon factor. Hence $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are polynomials in $x^3$. Likewise,\n$c(y)$ and $d(y)$ are polynomials in $y^3$. But then $1 + xy + x^2 y^2 =\na(x)d(y) - b(x) c(y)$ is a polynomial in $x^3$ and $y^3$, contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Note:}\nThe third solution only works over fields of characteristic not equal to 3,\nwhereas the other two work over arbitrary fields. (In the first solution,\none must replace $-1$ by another value if working in characteristic 2.)"
