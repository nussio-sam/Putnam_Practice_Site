      "content": "The values of $n$ in question are the multiples of 3 starting with 9. Note that we interpret ``distinct'' in the problem statement to mean ``pairwise distinct'' (i.e., no two equal). See the remark below.\n\nWe first show that such a sequence can only occur when $n$ is divisible by 3.\nIf $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the common differences of the arithmetic progressions $\\{x_m, x_{m+1}, x_{m+2}\\}$ and $\\{x_{m+1}, x_{m+2}, x_{m+3}\\}$ for some $m$, then $d_2 \\in \\{d_1, 2d_1, d_1/2\\}$. \nBy scaling we may assume that the smallest common difference that occurs is 1; in this case, all of the common differences are integers. By shifting, we may assume that the $x_i$ are themselves all integers. We now observe that any three consecutive terms in the sequence have pairwise distinct residues modulo 3, \nforcing $n$ to be divisible by 3.\n\nWe then observe that for any $m \\geq 2$, \nwe obtain a sequence of the desired form of length $3m+3 = (2m-1)+1+(m+1)+2$ by\nconcatenating the arithmetic progressions\n\\begin{gather*}\n(1, 3, \\dots, 4m-3, 4m-1), \\\\\n4m-2, (4m, 4m-4, \\dots, 4, 0), 2.\n\\end{gather*}\nWe see that no terms are repeated by noting that the first parenthesized sequence consists of odd numbers; the second sequence consists of multiples of 4; and the remaining numbers $2$ and $4m-2$ are distinct (because $m \\geq 2$) but both congruent to 2 mod 4.\n\nIt remains to show that no such sequence occurs with $n=6$.\nWe may assume without loss of generality that the smallest common difference among the arithmetic progressions is 1 and occurs for $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$; by rescaling, shifting, and reversing the sequence as needed, we may assume that\n$x_1 = 0$ and $(x_2, x_3) \\in \\{(1,2), (2,1)\\}$.\nWe then have $x_4 = 3$ and\n\\[\n(x_5, x_6) \\in \\{(4,5), (-1, -5), (-1, 7), (5, 4), (5, 7)\\}.\n\\]\nIn none of these cases does $\\{x_5, x_6, 0\\}$ form an arithmetic progression.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nIf one interprets ``distinct'' in the problem statement to mean ``not all equal'', then the problem becomes simpler:\nthe same argument as above shows that $n$ must be a multiple of 3, in which case a suitable repetition of the sequence $-1,0,1$ works."
