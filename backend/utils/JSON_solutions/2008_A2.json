If Alan ever writes a number in one of the first two\nrows, Barbara writes the same number in the other entry in the pair.\nIf Alan writes a number anywhere other than the first two rows, Barbara\ndoes likewise.\nAt the end, the resulting matrix will have two identical rows, so its\ndeterminant will be zero.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:} (by Manjul Bhargava)\nWhenever Alan writes a number $x$ in an entry in some row, Barbara writes\n$-x$ in some other entry in the same row.\nAt the end, the resulting matrix will have all rows summing to zero,\nso it cannot have full rank."
