      "content": "Let $(a_1,a_2)$ and $(a_1',a_2')$ be distinct points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$; we want to show that $f(a_1,a_2) \\neq f(a_1',a_2')$. Write $(v_1,v_2) = (a_1',a_2')-(a_1,a_2)$, and let $\\gamma(t) = (a_1,a_2)+t(v_1,v_2)$, $t \\in [0,1]$, be the path between $(a_1,a_2)$ and $(a_1',a_2')$. Define a real-valued function $g$ by $g(t) = (v_1,v_2) \\cdot f(\\gamma(t))$.\nBy the Chain Rule, \n\\[\nf'(\\gamma(t)) = \\left( \\begin{matrix} \\partial f_1/\\partial x_1 & \\partial f_1/\\partial x_2 \\\\ \\partial f_2/\\partial x_1 & \\partial f_2/\\partial x_2 \\end{matrix} \\right) \\left(\n\\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{matrix} \\right). \n\\]\nAbbreviate $\\partial f_i/\\partial x_j$ by $f_{ij}$; then\n\\begin{align*}\ng'(t) &= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 \\end{matrix} \\right) \\left( \\begin{matrix} f_{11} & f_{12} \\\\ f_{21} & f_{22} \\end{matrix} \\right) \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{matrix} \\right) \\\\\n&= f_{11} v_1^2 + (f_{12}+f_{21})v_1v_2+f_{22} v_2^2 \\\\\n&= f_{11} \\left(v_1+\\frac{f_{12}+f_{21}}{2f_{11}} v_2 \\right)^2 + \\frac{4f_{11}f_{22}-(f_{12}+f_{21})^2}{4f_{11}} v_2^2 \\\\\n& \\geq 0\n\\end{align*}\nsince $f_{11}$ and $f_{11}f_{22}-(f_{12}+f_{21})^2/4$ are positive by assumption. Since the only way that equality could hold is if $v_1$ and $v_2$ are both $0$, we in fact have $g'(t)>0$ for all $t$. But if $f(a_1,a_2) = f(a_1',a_2')$, then $g(0) = g(1)$, a contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nA similar argument shows more generally that $f:\\thinspace \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is injective if at all points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the Jacobian matrix $Df$ satisfies the following property: the quadratic form associated to the bilinear form with matrix $Df$ (or the symmetrized bilinear form with matrix $(Df+(Df)^T)/2$) is positive definite. In the setting of the problem, the symmetrized matrix is\n\\[\n\\left( \\begin{matrix} f_{11} & (f_{12}+f_{21})/2 \\\\ (f_{12}+f_{21})/2 & f_{22} \\end{matrix} \\right),\n\\]\nand this is positive definite if and only if $f_{11}$ and the determinant of the matrix are both positive\n(Sylvester's criterion). Note that the assumptions that $f_{12},f_{21}>0$ are unnecessary for the argument;\nit is also easy to see that the hypotheses $f_{11}, f_{12} > 0$ are also superfluous.\n(The assumption $f_{11}f_{22}-(f_{12}+f_{21})^2 > 0$ implies $f_{11} f_{22} > 0$, so both are nonzero and of the same sign; by continuity, this common sign must be constant over all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If it is negative, then\napply the same logic to $(-f_1, -f_2)$.)"
