      "content": "Suppose by way of contradiction that $f(1/2)$ is rational. Then $\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} c_i 2^{-i}$ is the binary expansion of a rational number, and hence must be eventually periodic; that is, there exist some integers $m,n$ such that\n$c_i = c_{m+i}$ for all $i \\geq n$. We may then write\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^i + \\frac{x^n}{1-x^m} \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} c_{n+i} x^i.\n\\]\nEvaluating at $x = 2/3$, we may equate $f(2/3) = 3/2$ with \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3^{n-1}} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i 2^i 3^{n-i-1} + \\frac{2^n 3^m}{3^{n+m-1}(3^m-2^m)} \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} c_{n+i} 2^i 3^{m-1-i};\n\\]\nsince all terms on the right-hand side have odd denominator, the same must be true of the sum, a contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nGreg Marks asks whether the assumption that $f(2/3)=3/2$ further ensures that $f(1/2)$ is transcendental. \nWe do not know of any existing results that would imply this. However, the following result follows from a theorem of T. Tanaka (Algebraic independence of the values of power series generated by linear recurrences, \\textit{Acta Arith.} \\textbf{74} (1996), 177--190), building upon work of Mahler.\nLet $\\{a_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ be a linear recurrent sequence of positive integers with characteristic polynomial $P$.\nSuppose that $P(0), P(1), P(-1) \\neq 0$ and that no two distinct roots of $P$ have ratio which is a root of unity. Then\nfor $f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^{a_n}$, the values $f(1/2)$ and $f(2/3)$ are algebraically independent over $\\QQ$.\n(Note that for $f$ as in the original problem, the condition on ratios of roots of $P$ fails.)"
