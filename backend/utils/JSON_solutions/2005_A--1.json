      "content": "We proceed by induction, with base case $1 = 2^0 3^0$. Suppose all\nintegers less than $n-1$ can be represented. If $n$ is even, then\nwe can take a representation of $n/2$ and multiply each term by 2 to\nobtain a representation of $n$. If $n$ is odd,\nput $m = \\lfloor \\log_3 n\n\\rfloor$, so that $3^m \\leq n < 3^{m+1}$. If $3^m = n$, we are done.\nOtherwise, choose a representation $(n-3^m)/2 = s_1 + \\cdots + s_k$\nin the desired form. Then\n\\[\nn = 3^m + 2s_1 + \\cdots + 2s_k,\n\\]\nand clearly none of the $2s_i$ divide each other or $3^m$. Moreover,\nsince $2s_i \\leq n-3^m < 3^{m+1} - 3^m$, we have $s_i < 3^m$,\nso $3^m$ cannot divide $2s_i$ either. Thus $n$ has a representation\nof the desired form in all cases, completing the induction.\n\n\\textbf{Remarks:}\nThis problem is originally due to Paul Erd\\H{o}s.\nNote that the representations need not be unique: for instance,\n\\[\n11 = 2+9 = 3+8.\n\\]"
