      "content": "The answer is yes. We first note that for any collection of $m$\ndays with $1\\leq m\\leq 2n-1$, there are at least $m$ distinct teams that\nwon a game on at least one of those days. If not, then any of the teams\nthat lost games on all of those days must in particular have lost to $m$\nother teams, a contradiction.\n\nIf we now construct a bipartite graph whose vertices are the $2n$ teams\nand the $2n-1$ days, with an edge linking a day to a team if that team\nwon their game on that day, then any collection of $m$ days is connected\nto a total of at least $m$ teams. It follows from Hall's Marriage Theorem\nthat one can match the $2n-1$ days with $2n-1$ distinct teams that won on\ntheir respective days, as desired."
