If we write, e.g., $x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1)$ for the result of differentiating (1) by $x$ and multiplying the resulting equation by $x$, then the combination\n$x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1)+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(1)-(1)-(2)$ gives the equation\n$2xyf_{xy} = xy\\ln(xy)+xy$, whence $f_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(x)+\\ln(y)+1)$.\n\nNow we observe that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lefteqn{f(s+1,s+1)-f(s+1,s)-f(s,s+1)+f(s,s)} \\\\\n &= \\int_s^{s+1} \\int_s^{s+1} f_{xy}\\,dy\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_s^{s+1} \\int_s^{s+1} (\\ln(x)+\\ln(y)+1)\\,dy\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} + \\int_s^{s+1} \\ln(x)\\,dx.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $\\ln(x)$ is increasing, $\\int_s^{s+1} \\ln(x)\\,dx$ is an increasing function of $s$, and so it is minimized over $s \\in [1,\\infty)$ when $s=1$. We conclude that\n\\[\nm(f) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\int_1^2 \\ln(x)\\,dx = 2 \\ln 2-\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nindependent of $f$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe phrasing of the question suggests that solvers were not expected to prove that $\\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty,\neven though this is necessary to make the definition of $m(f)$ logically meaningful. Existence will be explicitly established in the next solution.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Solution 2.}\nWe first verify that \n\\[\nf(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(xy\\ln(xy)-xy)\n\\]\nis an element of $\\mathcal{F}$, by computing that\n\\begin{gather*}\nxf_x = yf_y = \\frac{1}{2} xy \\ln(xy) \\\\\nx^2 f_{xx} = y^2 f_{yy} = xy.\n\\end{gather*}\n(See the following remark for motivation for this guess.)\n\nWe next show that the only elements of $\\mathcal{F}$ are $f+a \\ln(x/y) + b$ where $a,b$ are constants.\nSuppose that $f+g$ is a second element of $\\mathcal{F}$. As in the first solution, we deduce that $g_{xy} = 0$; this implies that\n$g(x,y) = u(x) + v(y)$ for some twice continuously differentiable functions $u$ and $v$. We also have\n$xg_x + yg_y = 0$, which now asserts that $xg_x = - yg_y$ is equal to some constant $a$. This yields that\n$g = a \\ln(x/y) + b$ as desired.\n\nWe next observe that \n\\[\ng(s+1,s+1)-g(s+1,s)-g(s,s+1)+g(s,s) = 0,\n\\]\nso $m(f) = m(f+g)$. It thus remains to compute $m(f)$. To do this, we verify that\n\\[\nf(s+1,s+1)-f(s+1,s)-f(s,s+1)+f(s,s)\n\\]\nis nondecreasing in $s$ by computing its derivative to be $\\ln (s+1) - \\ln(s)$\n(either directly or using the integral representation from the first solution).\nWe thus minimize by taking $s=1$ as in the first solution.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nOne way to make a correct guess for $f$ is to notice that the given equations are both symmetric in $x$ and $y$\nand posit that $f$ should also be symmetric. Any symmetric function of $x$ and $y$ can be written in terms of the variables $u = x+y$ and $v = xy$, so in principle we could translate the equations into those variables and solve. However, before trying this, we observe that $xy$ appears explicitly in the equations, so it is reasonable to make a first guess of the form $f(x,y) = h(xy)$. \nFor such a choice, we have\n\\[\nx f_x + y f_y = 2xy h' = xy \\ln(xy)\n\\]\nwhich forces us to set $h(t)  = \\frac{1}{2}(t \\ln(t) - t)$."
