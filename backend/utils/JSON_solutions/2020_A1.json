      "content": "The values of $N$ that satisfy (ii) and (iii) are precisely the numbers of the form $N = (10^a-10^b)/9$ for $0\\leq b<a\\leq 2020$; this expression represents the integer with $a$ digits beginning with a string of $1$'s and ending with $b$ $0$'s. A value $N$ of this form is divisible by $2020 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 101$ if and only if $10^b(10^{a-b}-1)$ is divisible by each of $3^2$, $2^2\\cdot 5$, and $101$. Divisibility by $3^2$ is a trivial condition since $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$. Since $10^{a-b}-1$ is odd, divisibility by $2^2\\cdot 5$ occurs if and only if $b \\geq 2$. Finally, since $10^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{101}$, we see that $10^{a-b}$ is congruent to $10$, $-1$, $-10$, or $1 \\pmod{101}$ depending on whether $a-b$ is congruent to $1$, $2$, $3$, or $0 \\pmod{4}$; thus $10^{a-b}-1$ is divisible by $101$ if and only if $a-b$ is divisible by $4$.\n\nIt follows that we need to count the number of $(a,b)$ with $2\\leq b<a\\leq 2020$ with $4\\,|\\,a-b$. For given $b$, there are $\\lfloor \\frac{2020-b}{4} \\rfloor$ possible values of $a$. Thus the answer is\n\\begin{align*}\n& 504+504+504+503+503+503+503+\\cdots+1+1+1+1  \\\\\n&\\quad = 4(504+503+\\cdots+1)-504 = 504\\cdot 1009 = 508536.\n\\end{align*}"
