      "content": "Use the following strategy: guess $1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, \\dots$\nuntil the target number $n$ is revealed to be equal to or lower than one\nof these guesses. If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, it will be guessed on an\nodd turn. If $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, it will be guessed on an even turn.\nIf $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $n+1$ will be guessed on an even turn,\nforcing a guess of $n$ on the next turn. Thus the probability\nof success with this strategy is $1335/2002 > 2/3$.\n\nNote: for any positive integer $m$, this strategy wins when the\nnumber is being guessed from $[1,m]$ with probability\n$\\frac{1}{m} \\lfloor \\frac{2m+1}{3} \\rfloor$. We can prove that\nthis is best possible as follows.\nLet $a_m$ denote $m$ times\nthe probability of winning when playing optimally.  Also, let $b_m$\ndenote $m$ times the corresponding probability of winning if the\nobjective is to select the number in an even number of guesses\ninstead.  (For definiteness, extend the definitions to incorporate\n$a_0 = 0$ and $b_0=0$.)\n\nWe first claim that $a_m = 1 + \\max_{1\\leq k\\leq m} \\{b_{k-1} +\nb_{m-k}\\}$ and $b_m = \\max_{1\\leq k\\leq m} \\{a_{k-1} + a_{m-k}\\}$ for $m\n\\geq 1$.  To establish the first recursive identity, suppose that our\nfirst guess is some integer $k$. We automatically win if $n=k$, with\nprobability $1/m$. If $n<k$, with probability $(k-1)/m$, then we wish\nto guess an integer in $[1,k-1]$ in an even number of guesses; the\nprobability of success when playing optimally is $b_{k-1}/(k-1)$, by\nassumption.  Similarly, if $n<k$, with probability $(m-k)/m$, then the\nsubsequent probability of winning is $b_{m-k}/(m-k)$.  In sum, the\noverall probability of winning if $k$ is our first guess is\n$(1+b_{k-1}+b_{m-k})/m$. For optimal strategy, we choose $k$ such that\nthis quantity is maximized. (Note that this argument still holds if\n$k=1$ or $k=m$, by our definitions of $a_0$ and $b_0$.)  The first\nrecursion follows, and the second recursion is established similarly.\n\nWe now prove by induction that $a_m = \\lfloor (2m+1)/3 \\rfloor$ and\n$b_m = \\lfloor 2m/3 \\rfloor$ for $m \\geq 0$. The inductive step relies\non the inequality $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\leq \\lfloor\nx+y \\rfloor$, with equality when one of $x,y$ is an integer. Now\nsuppose that $a_i = \\lfloor (2i+1)/3 \\rfloor$ and\n$b_i = \\lfloor 2i/3 \\rfloor$ for $i < m$. Then\n\\begin{align*}\n1+b_{k-1}+b_{m-k} &= 1+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(k-1)}{3} \\right\\rfloor +\n\\left\\lfloor\n\\frac{2(m-k)}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\\\\n&\\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2m}{3} \\right\\rfloor\n\\end{align*}\nand similarly $a_{k-1}+a_{m-k} \\leq \\lfloor (2m+1)/3 \\rfloor$, with\nequality in both cases attained, e.g., when $k=1$.\nThe inductive formula for $a_m$ and $b_m$ follows."
