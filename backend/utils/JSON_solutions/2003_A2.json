      "content": "\\textbf{First solution:}\nAssume without loss of generality that $a_i + b_i > 0$\nfor each $i$ (otherwise both sides of the desired inequality are zero).\nThen the AM-GM inequality gives\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\left( \\frac{a_1\\cdots a_n}{(a_1+b_1)\\cdots(a_n+b_n)} \\right)^{1/n} \\\\\n\\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{a_1}{a_1 + b_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_n}{a_n+b_n}\n\\right),\n\\end{multline*}\nand likewise with the roles of $a$ and $b$ reversed. Adding these two\ninequalities and clearing denominators yields the desired result.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nWrite the desired inequality in the form\n\\[\n(a_1 + b_1)\\cdots(a_n+b_n) \\geq\n[(a_1\\cdots a_n)^{1/n} + (b_1\\cdots b_n)^{1/n}]^n,\n\\]\nexpand both sides, and compare the terms on both sides\nin which $k$ of the terms are among the $a_i$. On the left,\none has the product of each $k$-element subset of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$;\non the right, one has\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} (a_1\\cdots a_n)^{k/n} \\cdots (b_1 \\dots b_n)^{(n-k)/n},\n\\]\nwhich is precisely $\\binom{n}{k}$ times the geometric mean of the terms\non the left.  Thus AM-GM shows that the terms under consideration on the\nleft exceed those on the right; adding these inequalities over all $k$\nyields the desired result.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\nSince both sides are continuous in each $a_i$, it is sufficient to\nprove the claim with $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ all positive (the general case\nfollows by taking limits as some of the $a_i$ tend to zero).\nPut $r_i = b_i/a_i$; then the given inequality is equivalent to\n\\[\n(1 + r_1)^{1/n} \\cdots (1+r_n)^{1/n} \\geq 1 + (r_1\\cdots r_n)^{1/n}.\n\\]\nIn terms of the function\n\\[\nf(x) = \\log(1 + e^x)\n\\]\nand the quantities $s_i = \\log r_i$,\nwe can rewrite the desired inequality as\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n}(f(s_1) + \\cdots + f(s_n)) \\geq f\\left( \\frac{s_1 + \\cdots +\ns_n}{n} \\right).\n\\]\nThis will follow from Jensen's inequality if we can verify that $f$\nis a convex function; it is enough to check that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nIn fact,\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+e^x}\n\\]\nis an increasing function of $x$, so $f''(x) > 0$ and Jensen's inequality\nthus yields the desired result. (As long as the $a_i$ are all positive,\nequality holds when $s_1 = \\cdots = s_n$, i.e., when the vectors\n$(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$. Of course other equality\ncases crop up if some of the $a_i$ vanish, i.e., if $a_1=b_1=0$.)\n\n\\textbf{Fourth solution:}\nWe apply induction on $n$, the case $n=1$ being evident.\nFirst we verify the auxiliary inequality\n\\[\n(a^n + b^n)(c^n + d^n)^{n-1} \\geq (ac^{n-1} + b d^{n-1})^n\n\\]\nfor $a,b,c,d \\geq 0$.\nThe left side can be written as\n\\begin{align*}\na^n c^{n(n-1)} &+ b^n d^{n(n-1)} \\\\\n&+ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{i} b^n c^{ni} d^{n(n-1-i)} \\\\\n&+ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{i-1} a^n c^{n(i-1)} d^{n(n-i)}.\n\\end{align*}\nApplying the weighted AM-GM inequality between matching terms in the two\nsums yields\n\\begin{multline*}\n(a^n + b^n)(c^n + d^n)^{n-1} \\geq a^n c^{n(n-1)} + b^n d^{n(n-1)} \\\\\n+ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{i} a^i b^{n-i} c^{(n-1)i} d^{(n-1)(n-i)},\n\\end{multline*}\nproving the auxiliary inequality.\n\nNow given the auxiliary inequality and the $n-1$ case of the desired\ninequality, we apply the auxiliary inequality with $a = a_1^{1/n}$,\n$b = b_1^{1/n}$, $c = (a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/n(n-1)}$,\n$d = (b_2 \\dots b_n)^{1/n(n-1)}$. The right side will be the $n$-th\npower of the desired inequality. The left side comes out to\n\\[\n(a_1 + b_1)((a_2 \\cdots a_n)^{1/(n-1)} + (b_2 \\cdots b_n)^{1/(n-1)})^{n-1},\n\\]\nand by the induction hypothesis, the second factor is less than\n$(a_2 + b_2)\\cdots(a_n+b_n)$. This yields the desired result.\n\n\\textbf{Note:}\nEquality holds if and only if $a_i=b_i=0$ for some $i$ or if the vectors\n$(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and $(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$ are proportional.\nAs pointed out by Naoki Sato, the problem also appeared on the 1992\nIrish Mathematical Olympiad.\nIt is also a special case of a classical inequality,\nknown as H\\\"older's inequality, which generalizes the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality (this is visible from the $n=2$ case); the\nfirst solution above is adapted from the standard proof of H\\\"older's\ninequality.\nWe don't know whether the declaration\n``Apply H\\\"older's inequality'' by itself is considered\nan acceptable solution to this problem."
