      "content": "The minimum is 4, achieved by the square with vertices $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$.\n\n\\textbf{First solution:}\nTo prove that 4 is a lower bound, let $S$ be a convex set of the desired\nform. Choose $A,B,C,D \\in S$ lying on the branches of the two hyperbolas,\nwith $A$ in the upper right\nquadrant, $B$ in the upper left, $C$ in the lower left, $D$ in the lower right.\nThen the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a lower bound for\nthe area of $S$.\n\nWrite $A = (a,1/a)$,\n$B = (-b,1/b)$, $C = (-c,-1/c)$, $D = (d, -1/d)$ with $a,b,c,d > 0$.\nThen the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(a/b + b/c + c/d + d/a + b/a + c/b + d/c + a/d),\n\\]\nwhich by the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality is at least\n$4$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nChoose $A,B,C,D$ as in the first solution.\nNote that both the hyperbolas and the area of the convex hull of $ABCD$ are\ninvariant under the transformation $(x,y) \\mapsto (xm, y/m)$ for any\n$m>0$. For $m$ small, the counterclockwise angle from the line $AC$ to\nthe line $BD$ approaches 0; for $m$ large, this angle approaches $\\pi$.\nBy continuity, for some $m$ this angle becomes $\\pi/2$, that is,\n$AC$ and $BD$ become perpendicular. The area of $ABCD$\nis then $AC \\cdot BD$.\n\nIt thus suffices to note that $AC \\geq 2 \\sqrt{2}$ (and similarly for $BD$).\nThis holds because if we draw the tangent lines to the hyperbola $xy=1$\nat the points $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$, then $A$ and $C$ lie outside the region\nbetween these lines. If we project the segment $AC$ orthogonally\nonto the line $x=y=1$, the resulting projection has length at\nleast $2 \\sqrt{2}$,\nso $AC$ must as well.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\n(by Richard Stanley)\nChoose $A,B,C,D$ as in the first solution. Now fixing $A$ and $C$, move $B$ and\n$D$ to the points at which the tangents to the curve are parallel to the line\n$AC$. This does not increase the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ (even if\nthis quadrilateral is not convex).\n\nNote that $B$ and $D$ are now diametrically opposite; write $B = (-x, 1/x)$\nand $D = (x, -1/x)$. If we thus repeat the\nprocedure, fixing $B$ and $D$ and moving $A$ and $C$ to the points where the\ntangents are parallel to $BD$, then $A$ and $C$ must move to $(x, 1/x)$\nand $(-x,-1/x)$, respectively, forming a rectangle of area 4.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nMany geometric solutions are possible. An example suggested by David Savitt\n(due to Chris Brewer):\nnote that $AD$ and $BC$ cross the\npositive and negative $x$-axes, respectively, so the convex hull of $ABCD$\ncontains $O$. Then check that the area of triangle $OAB$ is at least 1, et cetera."
