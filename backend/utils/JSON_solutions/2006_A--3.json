      "content": "We first observe that given any sequence of integers\n$x_1, x_2, \\dots$ satisfying a recursion\n\\[\nx_k = f(x_{k-1}, \\dots, x_{k-n}) \\qquad (k > n),\n\\]\nwhere $n$ is fixed and $f$ is a fixed polynomial of $n$ variables with\ninteger coefficients, for any positive integer $N$, the sequence modulo $N$\nis eventually periodic. This is simply because there are only finitely many\npossible sequences of $n$ consecutive values modulo $N$, and once such\na sequence is repeated, every subsequent value is repeated as well.\n\nWe next observe that if one can rewrite the same recursion as\n\\[\nx_{k-n} = g(x_{k-n+1}, \\dots, x_k) \\qquad (k > n),\n\\]\nwhere $g$ is also a polynomial with integer coefficients, then\nthe sequence extends uniquely to a doubly infinite sequence $\\dots,\nx_{-1}, x_0, x_1, \\dots$ which is fully periodic modulo any $N$.\nThat is the case in the\nsituation at hand, because we can rewrite the given recursion as\n\\[\nx_{k-2005} = x_{k+1} - x_k.\n\\]\nIt thus suffices to find 2005 consecutive terms divisible by $N$ in the\ndoubly infinite sequence, for any fixed $N$ (so in particular for\n$N = 2006$).\nRunning the recursion backwards, we easily find\n\\begin{gather*}\nx_1 = x_0 = \\cdots = x_{-2004} = 1 \\\\\nx_{-2005} = \\cdots = x_{-4009} = 0,\n\\end{gather*}\nyielding the desired result."
