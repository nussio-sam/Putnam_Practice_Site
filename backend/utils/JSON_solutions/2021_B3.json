      "content": "We prove the given statement.\n\nFor any circle $\\mathcal{S}$ of radius $r$ whose center is at distance $d$ from the origin, express the integral in polar coordinates $s,\\theta$:\n\\[\n\\iint_{\\mathcal{S}} \\rho = \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} \\int_{\\theta_1(s)}^{\\theta_2(s)} (yh_x - xh_y)(s \\sin \\theta, s \\cos \\theta) s\\,d\\theta\\,ds.\n\\]\nFor fixed $s$, the integral over $\\theta$ is a line integral of $\\mathrm{grad} \\, h$, which evaluates to $h(P_2) - h(P_1)$\nwhere $P_1, P_2$ are the endpoints of the endpoints of the arc of the circle of radius $s$ centered at the origin lying within $\\mathcal{S}$. If we now fix $r$ and $d$ and integrate $\\iint_{\\mathcal{S}} \\rho$ over all choices of $\\mathcal{S}$ (this amounts to a single integral over an angle in the range $[0, 2\\pi]$), we may interchange the order of integration to first integrate over $\\theta$,\nthen over the choice of $\\mathcal{S}$, and at this point we get 0 for every $s$.\nWe conclude that the integral of $\\iint_{\\mathcal{S}}$ over all choices of $\\mathcal{S}$ vanishes; since the given integral varies continuously in $\\mathcal{S}$, by the intermediate value theorem there must be some $\\mathcal{S}$  where the given integral is 0."
