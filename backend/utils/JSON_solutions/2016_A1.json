      "content": "The answer is $j=8$. First suppose that $j$ satisfies the given condition. For $p(x) = x^j$, we have $p^{(j)}(x) = j!$ and thus $j!$ is divisible by $2016$. Since $2016$ is divisible by $2^5$ and $7!$ is not, it follows that $j \\geq 8$. Conversely, we claim that $j=8$ works. Indeed, let $p(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^n a_m x^m$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients; then if $k$ is any integer, \n\\begin{align*}\np^{(8)}(k) &= \\sum_{m=8}^n m(m-1)\\cdots (m-7) a_m k^{m-8} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{m=8}^n {m\\choose 8} 8! a_m k^{m-8}\n\\end{align*}\nis divisible by $8! = 20 \\cdot 2016$, and so $p^{(8)}(k)$ is divisible by $2016$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nBy the same reasoning, if one replaces $2016$ in the problem by a general integer $N$,\nthen the minimum value of $j$ is the smallest one for which $N$ divides $j!$.\nThis can be deduced from P\\'olya's observation that the set of integer-valued polynomials is the free $\\ZZ$-module generated by the binomial polynomials $\\binom{x}{n}$ for $n=0,1,\\dots$. That statement can be extended to polynomials evaluated on a subset of a Dedekind domain using Bhargava's method of \\emph{$P$-orderings}; we do not know if this generalization can be adapted to the analogue of this problem, where one considers polynomials whose $j$-th derivatives take integral values on a prescribed subset."
