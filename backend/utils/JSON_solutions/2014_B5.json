      "content": "We show that Patniss wins if $p=2$ and Keeta wins if $p>2$ (for all $n$).\nWe first analyze the analogous game played using an arbitrary finite group $G$.\nRecall that for any subset $S$ of $G$, the set of elements $g \\in G$ which commute with all elements of $S$ forms a subgroup $Z(S)$ of $G$, called the \\emph{centralizer} (or \\emph{commutant}) of $S$. \nAt any given point in the game, the set $S$ of previously chosen elements is contained in $Z(S)$. Initially $S = \\emptyset$ and $Z(S) = G$;\nafter each turn, $S$ is increased by one element and $Z(S)$ is replaced by a subgroup.\nIn particular, if the order of $Z(S)$ is odd at some point, it remains odd thereafter;\nconversely, if $S$ contains an element of even order, then the order of $Z(S)$ remains even thereafter. Therefore, any element $g \\in G$ for which $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order is a winning first move for Patniss, while any other first move by Patniss loses if Keeta responds with some $h \\in Z(\\{g\\})$ of even order (e.g., an element of a 2-Sylow subgroup of $Z(\\{g\\})$). In both cases, the win is guaranteed no matter what moves follow.\n\nNow let $G$ be the group of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices with entries in $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$.\nIf $p>2$, then $Z(S)$ will always contain the scalar matrix $-1$ of order 2, so the win for Keeta is guaranteed. (An explicit winning strategy is to answer any move $g$ with the move $-g$.)\n\nIf $p=2$, we establish the existence of $g \\in G$ such that $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order\nusing the existence of an irreducible polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ (see remark). We construct an $n \\times n$ matrix over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ with characteristic polynomial $P(x)$ by taking the \\emph{companion matrix} of $P(x)$: write $P(x) = x^n + P_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + P_0$ and set\n\\[\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 & -P_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 & -P_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nIn particular, $\\det(g) = (-1)^n P_0 \\neq 0$, so $g \\in G$.\nOver an algebraic closure of $\\ZZ/p \\ZZ$, $g$ becomes diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues, so any matrix commuting with $g$ must also be diagonalizable, and hence of odd order. In particular, $Z(\\{g\\})$ is of odd order, so Patniss has a winning strategy.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIt can be shown that in the case $p=2$, the only elements $g \\in G$ for which $Z(\\{g\\})$ has odd order are those for which $g$ has distinct eigenvalues: in any other case, $Z(\\{g\\})$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to the group of $k \\times k$ invertible matrices over $\\ZZ/2\\ZZ$ for some $k>1$, and this group has order $(2^k-1)(2^k-2) \\cdots(2^k - 2^{k-1})$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nWe sketch two ways to verify the existence of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ for any positive integer $n$ and any prime number $p$. One is to use M\\\"obius inversion to count the number of irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ and then give a positive lower bound for this count. The other is to first establish the existence of a finite field $\\FF$ of cardinality $p^n$, e.g., as the set of roots of the polynomial $x^{p^n}-1$ inside a splitting field, and then take the minimal polynomial of a nonzero element of $\\FF$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$ which is a primitive $(p^n-1)$-st root of unity in $\\FF$ (which exist because the multiplicative group of $\\FF$ contains at most one cyclic subgroup of any given order). One might be tempted to apply the primitive element theorem for $\\FF$ over $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$, but in fact one of the preceding techniques is needed in order to verify this result for finite fields, as the standard argument that ``most'' elements of the upper field are primitive breaks down for finite fields.\n\nOne may also describe the preceding analysis in terms of an identification of $\\FF$ as a $\\ZZ/p\\ZZ$-vector space with the space of column vectors of length $n$. Under such an identification, if we take $g$ to be an element of $\\FF - \\{0\\}$ generating this group, then any element of $Z(\\{g\\})$ commutes with all of $\\FF- \\{0\\}$ and hence must define an $\\FF$-linear endomorphism of $\\FF$. Any such endomorphism is itself multiplication by an element of $\\FF$, so $Z(\\{g\\})$ is identified with the multiplicative group of $\\FF$, whose order is the odd number $2^n-1$."
