For the condition to make sense, $f$ must be differentiable.\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing, we must have $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$.\nAlso, the function $f'(x)$ is strictly increasing: if $y>x$ then $f'(y) = f(f(y)) > f(f(x)) = f'(x)$.\nIn particular, $f'(y) > 0$ for all $y \\in \\RR$.\n\nFor any $x_0 \\geq -1$, if $f(x_0) = b$ and $f'(x_0) = a > 0$, then $f'(x) > a$ for $x>x_0$ and thus $f(x) \\geq a(x-x_0)+b$ for $x\\geq x_0$. Then either $b < x_0$ or\n$a = f'(x_0) = f(f(x_0)) = f(b) \\geq a(b-x_0)+b$. In the latter case,\n$b \\leq a(x_0+1)/(a+1) \\leq x_0+1$. We conclude in either case that $f(x_0) \\leq x_0+1$ for all $x_0 \\geq -1$.\n\nIt must then be the case that $f(f(x)) = f'(x) \\leq 1$ for all $x$, since otherwise $f(x) > x+1$ for large $x$. Now by the above reasoning, if $f(0) = b_0$ and $f'(0) = a_0>0$, then $f(x) > a_0x+b_0$ for $x>0$. Thus for $x > \\max\\{0,-b_0/a_0\\}$, we have\n$f(x) > 0$ and $f(f(x)) > a_0x+b_0$. But then $f(f(x)) > 1$ for sufficiently large $x$, a contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\n(Communicated by Catalin Zara.)\nSuppose such a function exists. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and differentiable, so is $f \\circ f = f'$.\nIn particular, $f$ is twice differentiable; also, $f''(x) = f'(f(x)) f'(x)$ is the product of two strictly\nincreasing nonnegative functions, so it is also strictly increasing and nonnegative. In particular, we can choose\n$\\alpha>0$ and $M \\in \\RR$ such that $f''(x) > 4\\alpha$ for all $x \\geq M$. Then for all $x \\geq M$,\n\\[\nf(x) \\geq f(M) + f'(M)(x-M) + 2\\alpha (x-M)^2.\n\\]\nIn particular, for some $M' > M$, we have $f(x) \\geq \\alpha x^2$ for all $x \\geq M'$.\n\nPick $T>0$ so that $\\alpha T^2 > M'$. Then for $x \\geq T$,\n$f(x) > M'$ and so $f'(x) = f(f(x)) \\geq \\alpha f(x)^2$.\nNow\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f(T)} - \\frac{1}{f(2T)}\n= \\int_T^{2T} \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}\\,dt \\geq \\int_T^{2T} \\alpha\\,dt;\n\\]\nhowever, as $T \\to \\infty$, the left side of this inequality\ntends to 0 while the right side tends to $+\\infty$,\na contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\n(Communicated by Noam Elkies.)\nSince $f$ is strictly increasing, for some $y_0$, we can define the inverse function\n$g(y)$ of $f$ for $y \\geq y_0$. Then $x = g(f(x))$, and we may differentiate to find that\n$1 = g'(f(x)) f'(x) = g'(f(x)) f(f(x))$. It follows that $g'(y) = 1/f(y)$ for $y \\geq y_0$;\nsince $g$ takes arbitrarily large values, the integral $\\int_{y_0}^\\infty dy/f(y)$ must diverge.\nOne then gets a contradiction from any reasonable lower bound on $f(y)$ for $y$ large,\ne.g., the bound $f(x) \\geq \\alpha x^2$ from the second solution. (One can also\nstart with a linear lower bound $f(x) \\geq \\beta x$, then use the integral expression for $g$\nto deduce that $g(x) \\leq \\gamma \\log x$, which in turn forces $f(x)$ to grow exponentially.)"
