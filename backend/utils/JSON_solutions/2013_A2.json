      "content": "Suppose to the contrary that $f(n) = f(m)$ with $n<m$, and let $n\\cdot a_1\\cdots a_r$, $m\\cdot b_1\\cdots b_s$ be perfect squares where $n < a_1 < \\cdots < a_r$, $m < b_1 < \\cdots < b_s$, $a_r,b_s$ are minimal and $a_r=b_s$. Then $(n\\cdot a_1\\cdots a_r)\\cdot (m\\cdot b_1\\cdots b_s)$ is also a perfect square. Now eliminate any factor in this product that appears twice (i.e., if $a_i = b_j$ for some $i,j$, then delete $a_i$ and $b_j$ from this product). The product of what remains must also be a perfect square, but this is now a product of distinct integers, the smallest of which is $n$ and the largest of which is strictly smaller than $a_r = b_s$. This contradicts the minimality of $a_r$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nSequences whose product is a perfect square occur naturally in the \\emph{quadratic sieve} algorithm for factoring large integers. However,\nthe behavior of the function $f(n)$ seems to be somewhat erratic. \nKarl Mahlburg points out the upper bound $f(n) \\leq 2n$ for $n \\geq 5$, which holds because the interval $(n, 2n)$ contains an integer of the form $2m^2$. A trivial lower bound is $f(n) \\geq n+p$ where $p$ is the least prime factor of $n$. For $n = p$ prime, the bounds agree and we have $f(p) = 2p$.
