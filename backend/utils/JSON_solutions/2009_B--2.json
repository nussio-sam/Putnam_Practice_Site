      "content": "The desired real numbers $c$ are precisely those for which $1/3 < c \\leq 1$.\nFor any positive integer $m$ and any\nsequence $0 = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_m = 1$,\nthe cost of jumping along this sequence is\n$\\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - x_{i-1})x_i^2$. Since\n\\begin{align*}\n1 = \\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - x_{i-1}) &\\geq \\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - x_{i-1})x_i^2 \\\\\n&> \\sum_{i=1}^m \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i-1}} t^2\\,dt \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 t^2\\,dt = \\frac{1}{3},\n\\end{align*}\nwe can only achieve costs $c$ for which $1/3 < c \\leq 1$.\n\nIt remains to check that any such $c$ can be achieved.\nSuppose $0 = x_0 < \\dots < x_m = 1$ is a sequence with $m \\geq 1$.\nFor $i=1,\\dots,m$,\nlet $c_i$ be the cost of the sequence $0, x_i, x_{i+1},\\dots,x_m$.\nFor $i > 1$ and $0 < y \\leq x_{i-1}$,\nthe cost of the sequence $0, y, x_{i}, \\dots, x_m$\nis\n\\[\nc_{i} + y^3 + (x_i - y)x_i^2 - x_i^3\n= c_i - y(x_i^2 - y^2),\n\\]\nwhich is less than $c_i$ but approaches $c_i$ as $y \\to 0$.\nBy continuity, for $i=2,\\dots,m$,\nevery value in the interval $[c_{i-1}, c_{i})$ can be achieved,\nas can $c_m = 1$ by the sequence $0,1$.\n\nTo show that all costs $c$ with $1/3 < c \\leq 1$ can be achieved, it now suffices\nto check that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a sequence with cost at most\n$1/3 + \\epsilon$. For instance, if we take $x_i = i/m$ for $i=0,\\dots,m$, the cost\nbecomes\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m^3} (1^2 + \\cdots + m^2)\n = \\frac{(m+1)(2m+1)}{6m^2},\n\\]\nwhich converges to $1/3$ as $m \\to +\\infty$.\n\n\\textbf{Reinterpretation.} The cost of jumping along a particular sequence is an\nupper Riemann sum of the function $t^2$. The fact that this function admits a Riemann\nintegral implies that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta_0$ such that the\ncost of the sequence $x_0,\\dots,x_m$ is at most $1/3 + \\epsilon$ as long as\n$\\max_i \\{x_i - x_{i-1}\\} < \\epsilon$. (The computation of the integral using the\nsequence $x_i = i/m$ was already known to Archimedes.)"
