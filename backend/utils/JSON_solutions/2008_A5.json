      "content": "Form the polynomial $P(z) = f(z) + i g(z)$ with complex coefficients.\nIt suffices to prove that $P$ has degree at least $n-1$, as then one\nof $f, g$ must have degree at least $n-1$.\n\nBy replacing $P(z)$ with $a P(z) + b$ for suitable $a,b \\in \\CC$,\nwe can force the regular $n$-gon to have vertices\n$\\zeta_n, \\zeta_n^2, \\dots, \\zeta_n^n$ for\n$\\zeta_n = \\exp(2 \\pi i/n)$. It thus suffices to check that\nthere cannot exist a polynomial $P(z)$ of degree at most $n-2$\nsuch that $P(i) = \\zeta_n^i$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$.\n\nWe will prove more generally that for any complex number\n$t \\notin \\{0,1\\}$, and any integer $m \\geq 1$,\nany polynomial $Q(z)$ for which\n$Q(i) = t^i$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$ has degree at least $m-1$.\nThere are several ways to do this.\n\n\\textbf{First solution:}\nIf $Q(z)$ has degree $d$ and leading coefficient $c$,\nthen $R(z) = Q(z+1) - t Q(z)$ has degree $d$ and leading coefficient $(1-t)c$.\nHowever, by hypothesis, $R(z)$ has the distinct roots\n$1,2,\\dots,m-1$, so we must have $d \\geq m-1$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nWe proceed by induction on $m$.\nFor the base case $m=1$, we have $Q(1) = t^1 \\neq 0$,\nso $Q$ must be nonzero, and so its degree is at least $0$.\nGiven the assertion for $m-1$, if $Q(i) = t^i$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$,\nthen the polynomial $R(z) = (t-1)^{-1} (Q(z+1) - Q(z))$ has degree\none less than that of $Q$,\nand satisfies $R(i) = t^i$ for $i=1,\\dots,m-1$. Since $R$ must have\ndegree at least $m-2$ by the induction hypothesis, $Q$ must have\ndegree at least $m-1$.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\nWe use the method of \\emph{finite differences} (as in the second\nsolution) but without induction. Namely,\nthe $(m-1)$-st finite difference\nof $P$ evaluated at 1 equals\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} (-1)^j \\binom{m-1}{j} Q(m-j)\n= t(1 - t)^{m-1} \\neq 0,\n\\]\nwhich is impossible if $Q$ has degree less than $m-1$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} One can also establish the claim by computing\na Vandermonde-type determinant, or by using the Lagrange interpolation\nformula to compute the leading coefficient of $Q$."
