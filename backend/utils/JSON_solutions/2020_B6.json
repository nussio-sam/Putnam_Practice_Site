The first few terms of the sequence $\\{(-1)^{a_k}\\}$ are\n\\[\n1,1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,\\ldots.\n\\]\nDefine a new sequence $\\{c_i\\}_{i=0}^\\infty$ given by $3,2,3,2,3,\\ldots$, whose members alternately are the lengths of the clusters of consecutive $1$'s and the lengths of the clusters of consecutive $-1$'s in the sequence $\\{(-1)^{a_k}\\}$. Then for any $i$, $c_0+\\cdots+c_i$ is the number of nonnegative integers $k$ such that $\\lfloor k(\\sqrt{2}-1) \\rfloor$ is strictly less than $i+1$, i.e., such that $k(\\sqrt{2}-1)<i+1$. This last condition is equivalent to $k<(i+1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)$, and we conclude that \\begin{align*}\nc_0+\\cdots+c_i &= \\lfloor (i+1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)\\rfloor  + 1 \\\\\n&= 2i+3+\\lfloor (i+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\rfloor.\n\\end{align*}\nThus for $i>0$,\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:2020B6eq1}\nc_i =2+\\lfloor (i+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\rfloor-\\lfloor i(\\sqrt{2}-1) \\rfloor.\n\\end{equation}\nNow note that $\\lfloor (i+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\rfloor-\\lfloor i(\\sqrt{2}-1) \\rfloor$ is either $1$ or $0$ depending on whether or not there is an integer $j$ between $i(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ and $(i+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)$: this condition is equivalent to $i<j(\\sqrt{2}+1)<i+1$. That is, for $i>0$,\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:2020B6eq3}\nc_i = \\begin{cases} 3 & \\text{if } i=\\lfloor j(\\sqrt{2}+1)\\rfloor \\text{ for some integer }j, \\\\\n2 &\\text{otherwise};\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nby inspection, this also holds for $i=0$.\n\nNow we are asked to prove that\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:2020B6eq2}\n\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{a_k} \\geq 1\n\\end{equation}\nfor all $n\\geq 1$. We will prove that if \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq2} holds for all $n\\leq N$, then \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq2} holds for all $n\\leq 4N$; since \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq2} clearly holds for $n=1$, this will imply the desired result.\n\nSuppose that \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq2} holds for $n\\leq N$. To prove that \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq2} holds for $n\\leq 4N$, it suffices to show that the partial sums\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i c_i\n\\]\nof the sequence $\\{(-1)^{a_k}\\}$ are positive for all $m$ such that $c_0+\\cdots+c_{m-1}<4N+3$, since these partial sums cover all clusters through $a_{4N}$. Now if $c_0+\\cdots+c_{m-1}<4N+3$, then since each $c_i$ is at least $2$, we must have $m<2N+2$. From \\eqref{eq:2020B6eq3}, we see that if $m$ is odd, then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i c_i &= \\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i (c_i-2) \\\\\n&= \\sum_j (-1)^{\\lfloor j(\\sqrt{2}+1)\\rfloor} = \\sum_j (-1)^{a_j}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the sum in $j$ is over nonnegative integers $j$ with $j(\\sqrt{2}+1) < m$, i.e., $j <m(\\sqrt{2}-1)$; since $m(\\sqrt{2}-1)<m/2<N+1$,\n$\\sum_j (-1)^{a_j}$ is positive by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if $m$ is even, then $\\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i c_i = c_m+ \\sum_j (-1)^{a_j}$ and this is again positive by the induction hypothesis. This concludes the induction step and the proof.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nMore generally, using the same proof we can establish the result with $\\sqrt{2}-1$ replaced by $\\sqrt{n^2+1}-n$ for any positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\nFor $n \\geq 0$, define the function \n\\[\nf(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{\\lfloor k (\\sqrt{2}-1) \\rfloor}\n\\]\nwith the convention that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nDefine the sequence $q_0, q_1, \\dots$ by the initial conditions\n\\[\nq_0 = 0, q_1 = 1\n\\]\nand the recurrence relation\n\\[\n\\qquad q_j = 2q_{j-1} + q_{j-2}.\n\\]\nThis is OEIS sequence A000129; its first few terms are\n\\[\n0,1,2,5,12,29,70,\\dots.\n\\]\nNote that $q_j \\equiv j \\pmod{2}$.\n\nWe now observe that the fractions $q_{j-1}/q_j$ are the \\emph{convergents} of the continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{2}-1$.\nThis implies the following additional properties of the sequence.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nFor all $j \\geq 0$, \n\\[\n\\frac{q_{2j}}{q_{2j+1}} < \\sqrt{2}-1 < \\frac{q_{2j+1}}{q_{2j+2}}.\n\\]\n\\item\nThere is no fraction $r/s$ with $s < q_j + q_{j+1}$ such that\n$\\frac{r}{s}$ separates $\\sqrt{2}-1$ from $q_j/q_{j-1}$. In particular, for $k < q_j + q_{j+1}$,\n\\[\n\\lfloor k (\\sqrt{2}-1) \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{kq_{j-1}}{q_j} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\nexcept when $j$ is even and $k \\in \\{q_j, 2q_j\\}$, in which case they differ by 1."
