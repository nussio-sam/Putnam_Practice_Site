      "content": "Without loss of generality, assume $d_1\\leq d_2\\leq \\cdots \\leq d_{12}$.\nIf $d_{i+2}^2 < d_i^2+d_{i+1}^2$ for some $i\\leq 10$, then\n$d_i,d_{i+1},d_{i+2}$ are the side lengths of an acute triangle, since\nin this case $d_i^2 < d_{i+1}^2+d_{i+2}^2$ and $d_{i+1}^2 <\nd_i^2+d_{i+2}^2$ as well. Thus we may assume $d_{i+2}^2 \\geq d_i^2 +\nd_{i+1}^2$ for all $i$. But then by induction, $d_i^2 \\geq F_i d_1^2$\nfor all $i$, where $F_i$ is the $i$-th Fibonacci number (with\n$F_1=F_2=1$): $i=1$ is clear, $i=2$ follows from $d_2\\geq d_1$, and the\ninduction step follows from the assumed inequality. Setting $i=12$ now\ngives $d_{12}^2 \\geq 144 d_1^2$, contradicting $d_1>1$ and $d_{12}<12$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.} A materially equivalent problem appeared on the 2012\nUSA Mathematical Olympiad and USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad."
