Otherwise, let $a_ia_{i+1}\\cdots a_{j}$ denote the\nrightmost even-length return in $P$, and let $f(P)=(1,1)a_1a_2\\cdots\na_j(1,-1)a_{j+1}\\cdots a_{2n-2}$.  Then $f$ clearly maps the set of Dyck\n$(n-1)$-paths to the set of Dyck $n$-paths having no even return.\n\nWe claim that $f$ is bijective; to see this, we simply construct the\ninverse mapping.  Given an $n$-path $P$, let $R=a_ia_{i+1}...a_j$\ndenote the leftmost return in $P$, and let $g(P)$ denote the\npath obtained by removing $a_1$ and $a_j$ from $P$.  Then evidently\n$f \\circ g$ and $g \\circ f$ are identity maps, proving the claim.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:} (by Dan Bernstein)\nLet $C_n$ be the number of Dyck paths of length $n$, let $O_n$ be the number\nof Dyck paths whose final return has odd length, and let $X_n$ be the number\nof Dyck paths with no return of even length.\n\nWe first exhibit a recursion for $O_n$; note that $O_0 = 0$.\nGiven a Dyck $n$-path\nwhose final return has odd length, split it just after its next-to-last return.\nFor some $k$ (possibly zero), this yields\na Dyck $k$-path, an upstep, a Dyck $(n-k-1)$-path whose odd return\nhas even length, and a downstep. Thus for $n \\geq 1$,\n\\[\nO_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k (C_{n-k-1} - O_{n-k-1}).\n\\]\n\nWe next exhibit a similar recursion for $X_n$; note that $X_0 = 1$.\nGiven a Dyck $n$-path with no even return,\nsplitting as above yields for some $k$\na Dyck $k$-path with no even return,\nan upstep, a Dyck $(n-k-1)$-path whose final return has even length,\nthen a downstep. Thus for $n \\geq 1$,\n\\[\nX_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} X_k (C_{n-k-1} - O_{n-k-1}).\n\\]\n\nTo conclude, we verify that $X_n = C_{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 1$,\nby induction on $n$. This is\nclear for $n=1$ since $X_1 = C_0 = 1$. Given $X_k = C_{k-1}$ for $k<n$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nX_n  &=\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} X_k (C_{n-k-1} - O_{n-k-1}) \\\\\n&= C_{n-1} - O_{n-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_{k-1} (C_{n-k-1} - O_{n-k-1}) \\\\\n&= C_{n-1} - O_{n-1} + O_{n-1} \\\\\n&= C_{n-1},\n\\end{align*}\nas desired.\n\n\\textbf{Note:}\nSince the problem only asked about the \\emph{existence} of a\none-to-one correspondence, we believe that any proof, bijective or not,\nthat the two sets\nhave the same cardinality is an acceptable solution. (Indeed, it would be\nhighly unusual to insist on using or not using a specific proof technique!)\nThe second solution\nabove can also be phrased in terms of generating functions.\nAlso, the $C_n$ are well-known to equal the Catalan numbers\n$\\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}$; the problem at hand is part of a famous\nexercise in Richard Stanley's \\textit{Enumerative Combinatorics, Volume 1}\ngiving 66 combinatorial interpretations of the Catalan numbers."
