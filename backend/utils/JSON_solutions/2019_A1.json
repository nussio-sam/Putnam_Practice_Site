      "content": "The answer is all nonnegative integers not congruent to $3$ or $6 \\pmod{9}$. Let $X$ denote the given expression;\nwe first show that we can make $X$ equal to each of the claimed values. Write $B=A+b$ and $C=A+c$, so that\n\\[\nX = (b^2-bc+c^2)(3A+b+c).\n\\]\nBy taking $(b,c) = (0,1)$ or $(b,c) = (1,1)$, we obtain respectively $X = 3A+1$ and $X = 3A+2$; consequently, as $A$ varies, we achieve every nonnegative integer not divisible by 3. By taking $(b,c) = (1,2)$, we obtain $X = 9A+9$; consequently, as $A$ varies, we achieve every positive integer divisible by 9. We may also achieve $X=0$\nby taking $(b,c) = (0,0)$.\n\nIn the other direction, $X$ is always nonnegative: either apply the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, or write $b^2-bc+c^2 = (b - c/2)^2 + 3c^2/4$ to see that it is nonnegative.\nIt thus only remains to show that if $X$ is a multiple of $3$, then it is a multiple of $9$. Note that\n$3A+b+c \\equiv b+c \\pmod{3}$ and $b^2-bc+c^2 \\equiv (b+c)^2 \\pmod{3}$; consequently, if $X$ is divisible by $3$,\nthen $b+c$ must be divisible by $3$, so each factor in $X = (b^2-bc+c^2)(3A+b+c)$ is divisible by $3$.\nThis proves the claim.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe factorization of $X$ used above can be written more symmetrically as\n\\[\nX = (A+B+C)(A^2+B^2+C^2-AB-BC-CA).\n\\]\nOne interpretation of the factorization is that $X$ is the determinant of the circulant matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nA & B & C \\\\\nC & A & B \\\\\nB & C & A\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich has the vector $(1,1,1)$ as an eigenvector (on either side) with eigenvalue $A+B+C$. The other eigenvalues are $A + \\zeta B + \\zeta^2 C$ where $\\zeta$ is a primitive cube root of unity; in fact, $X$ is the norm form for the ring $\\ZZ[T]/(T^3 - 1)$, from which it follows directly that the image of $X$ is closed under multiplication. (This is similar to the fact that the image of $A^2+B^2$, which is the norm form for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ of Gaussian integers, is closed under multiplication.)\n\nOne can also the unique factorization property of the ring $\\ZZ[\\zeta]$ of Eisenstein integers as follows.\nThe three factors of $X$ over $\\ZZ[\\zeta_3]$ are pairwise congruent modulo $1-\\zeta_3$; consequently,\nif $X$ is divisible by 3, then it is divisible by $(1-\\zeta_3)^3 = -3\\zeta_3(1-\\zeta_3)$ and hence \n(because it is a rational integer) by $3^2$."
