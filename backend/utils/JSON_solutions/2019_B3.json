In particular, $P$ is an orthogonal matrix of determinant $-1$.\n\nWe next claim that if $Q$ is an $n\\times n$ orthogonal matrix that does not have $1$ as an eigenvalue, then $\\det Q = (-1)^n$. To see this, recall that the roots of the characteristic polynomial $p(t) = \\det(tI-Q)$ all lie on the unit circle in $\\mathbb{C}$, and all non-real roots occur in conjugate pairs ($p(t)$ has real coefficients, and orthogonality implies that $p(t) = \\pm t^n p(t^{-1})$). The product of each conjugate pair of roots is $1$; thus $\\det Q = (-1)^k$ where $k$ is the multiplicity of $-1$ as a root of $p(t)$. Since $1$ is not a root and all other roots appear in conjugate pairs, $k$ and $n$ have the same parity, and so $\\det Q = (-1)^n$.\n\nFinally, if neither of the orthogonal matrices $Q$ nor $PQ$ has $1$ as an eigenvalue, then $\\det Q = \\det(PQ) = (-1)^n$, contradicting the fact that $\\det P = -1$. The result follows.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nIt can be shown that any $n \\times n$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ can be written as a product of at most $n$ hyperplane reflections (Householder matrices). If equality occurs, then $\\det(Q) = (-1)^n$;\nif equality does not occur, then $Q$ has $1$ as an eigenvalue.\nConsequently, equality fails for one of $Q$ and $PQ$, and that matrix has $1$ as an eigenvalue.\n\nSucharit Sarkar suggests the following topological interpretation: an orthogonal matrix without 1 as an eigenvalue\ninduces a fixed-point-free map from the $(n-1)$-sphere to itself, and the degree of such a map must be $(-1)^n$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Solution 2.}\nThis solution uses the (reverse) \\emph{Cayley transform}: if $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix not having 1 as an eigenvalue, then\n\\[\nA = (I-Q)(I+Q)^{-1}\n\\]\nis a skew-symmetric matrix (that is, $A^T = -A$).\n\nSuppose then that $Q$ does not have $1$ as an eigenvalue.\nLet $V$ be the orthogonal complement of $u$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. On one hand, for $v \\in V$,\n\\[\n(I-Q)^{-1} (I - QP) v = (I-Q)^{-1} (I-Q)v = v.\n\\]\nOn the other hand,\n\\[\n(I-Q)^{-1} (I - QP) u = (I-Q)^{-1} (I+Q)u = Au\n\\]\nand $\\langle u, Au \\rangle = \\langle A^T u, u \\rangle\n= \\langle -Au, u \\rangle$, so $Au \\in V$.\nPut $w = (1-A)u$; then $(1-QP)w = 0$, so $QP$ has 1 as an eigenvalue, and the same for $PQ$ because $PQ$ and $QP$ have the same characteristic polynomial.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe \\emph{Cayley transform} is the following construction: if $A$ is a skew-symmetric matrix,\nthen $I+A$ is invertible and\n\\[\nQ = (I-A)(I+A)^{-1}\n\\]\nis an orthogonal matrix.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\n(by Steven Klee)\nA related argument is to compute $\\det(PQ-I)$ using the \\emph{matrix determinant lemma}:\nif $A$ is an invertible $n \\times n$ matrix and $v, w$ are $1 \\times n$ column vectors, then\n\\[\n\\det(A + vw^T) = \\det(A) (1 + w^T A^{-1} v).\n\\]\nThis reduces to the case $A = I$, in which case it again comes down to the fact that the product of two square matrices (in this case, obtained from $v$ and $w$ by padding with zeroes) retains the same characteristic polynomial when the factors are reversed."
