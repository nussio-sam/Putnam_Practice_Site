      "content": "The answer is $L = 4/7$. For $S \\subset \\mathbb{N}$, let $F(S) = \\sum_{n\\in S} 1/2^n$, so that $f(x) = F(S_x)$. Note that for $T = \\{1,4,7,10,\\ldots\\}$, we have $F(T) = 4/7$.\n\nWe first show by contradiction that for any $x \\in [0,1)$, $f(x) \\geq 4/7$.\nSince each term in the geometric series $\\sum_n 1/2^n$ is equal to the sum of all subsequent terms, if $S,S'$ are different subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ and the smallest positive integer in one of $S,S'$ but not in the other is in $S$, then $F(S) \\geq F(S')$. Assume $f(x) < 4/7$; then the smallest integer in one of $S_x,T$ but not in the other is in $T$. Now $1 \\in S_x$ for any $x \\in [0,1)$, and we conclude that there are three consecutive integers $n,n+1,n+2$ that are not in $S_x$: that is, $\\lfloor nx\\rfloor$, $\\lfloor (n+1)x\\rfloor$, $\\lfloor (n+2)x\\rfloor$ are all odd. Since the difference between consecutive terms in $nx$, $(n+1)x$, $(n+2)x$ is $x<1$, we conclude that $\\lfloor nx\\rfloor = \\lfloor (n+1)x\\rfloor = \\lfloor (n+2)x\\rfloor$ and so $x<1/2$. But then $2\\in S_x$ and so $f(x) \\geq 3/4$, contradicting our assumption.\n\nIt remains to show that $4/7$ is the greatest lower bound for $f(x)$, $x\\in [0,1)$.\nFor any $n$, choose $x = 2/3-\\epsilon$ with $0<\\epsilon<1/(9n)$; then for $1\\leq k\\leq n$, we have $0<m\\epsilon<1/3$ for $m \\leq 3n$, and so\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lfloor (3k-2)x \\rfloor &= \\lfloor (2k-2)+2/3-(3k-2)\\epsilon \\rfloor = 2k-2 \\\\\n\\lfloor (3k-1)x \\rfloor &= \\lfloor (2k-1)+1/3-(3k-1)\\epsilon \\rfloor = 2k-1 \\\\\n\\lfloor (3k)x \\rfloor &= \\lfloor (2k-1)+1-3k\\epsilon \\rfloor = 2k-1.\n\\end{align*}\nIt follows that $S_x$ is a subset of $S = \\{1,4,7,\\ldots,3n-2,3n+1,3n+2,3n+3,\\ldots\\}$, and so\n$f(x) = F(S_x) \\leq f(S) = (1/2+1/2^4+\\cdots+1/2^{3n+1})+1/2^{3n+1}$. This last expression tends to $4/7$ as $n\\to\\infty$, and so no number greater than $4/7$ can be a lower bound for $f(x)$ for all $x\\in [0,1)$."
