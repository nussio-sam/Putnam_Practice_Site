      "content": "The answer is $n=2^k-1$ for some integer $k\\geq 1$.\nThere is a bijection between mediocre subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and\nmediocre subsets of $\\{2,\\ldots,n+1\\}$ given by adding $1$ to each\nelement of the subset; thus $A(n+1)-A(n)$ is the number of mediocre\nsubsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n+1\\}$ that contain $1$. It follows that\n$A(n+2)-2A(n+1)+A_n = (A(n+2)-A(n+1))-(A(n+1)-A(n))$ is the difference\nbetween the number of mediocre subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$ containing\n$1$ and the number of mediocre subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n+1\\}$ containing\n$1$. This difference is precisely the number of mediocre subsets of\n$\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$ containing both $1$ and $n+2$, which we term\n``mediocre subsets containing the endpoints.'' Since $\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$\nitself is a mediocre subset of itself containing the endpoints, it\nsuffices to prove that this is the only mediocre subset of\n$\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$ containing the endpoints if and only if $n=2^k-1$ for\nsome $k$.\n\nIf $n$ is not of the form $2^k-1$, then we can write $n+1 = 2^a b$ for\nodd $b>1$. In this case, the set $\\{1+m b \\, | \\, 0 \\leq m \\leq 2^a\\}$\nis a mediocre subset of $\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$ containing the endpoints: the\naverage of $1+m_1 b$ and $1+m_2 b$, namely $1+\\frac{m_1+m_2}{2} b$, is\nan integer if and only if $m_1+m_2$ is even, in which case this average\nlies in the set.\n\nIt remains to show that if $n=2^k-1$, then the only mediocre subset of\n$\\{1,\\ldots,n+2\\}$ containing the endpoints is itself. This is readily\nseen by induction on $k$. For $k=1$, the statement is obvious. For\ngeneral $k$, any mediocre subset $S$ of $\\{1,\\ldots,n+2=2^k+1\\}$\ncontaining $1$ and $2^k+1$ must also contain their average, $2^{k-1}+1$.\nBy the induction assumption, the only mediocre subset of\n$\\{1,\\ldots,2^{k-1}+1\\}$ containing the endpoints is itself, and so $S$\nmust contain all integers between $1$ and $2^{k-1}+1$. Similarly, a\nmediocre subset of $\\{2^{k-1}+1,\\ldots,2^k+1\\}$ containing the endpoints\ngives a mediocre subset of $\\{1,\\ldots,2^{k-1}+1\\}$ containing the\nendpoints by subtracting $2^{k-1}$ from each element. By the induction\nassumption again, it follows that $S$ must contain all integers between\n$2^{k-1}+1$ and $2^k+1$. Thus $S = \\{1,\\ldots,2^k+1\\}$ and the induction\nis complete.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} One can also proceed by checking that a nonempty subset of\n$\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ is mediocre if and only if it is an arithmetic progression\nwith odd common difference. Given this fact, the number of\nmediocre subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,n+2\\}$ containing the endpoints is seen to be\nthe number of odd factors of $n+1$, from which the desired result is evident.\n(The sequence $A(n)$ appears as sequence A124197 in the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.)"
