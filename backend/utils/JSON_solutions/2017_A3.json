Since $\\int_a^b (f(x)-g(x))\\,dx = 0$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nI_1-I_0 &= \\int_a^b \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}(f(x)-g(x)) \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x)-g(x))^2}{g(x)} \\,dx > 0,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the inequality follows from the fact that the integrand is a nonnegative continuous function on $[a,b]$ that is not identically $0$. Now for $n \\geq 0$, the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality gives\n\\begin{align*}\nI_n I_{n+2} &= \\left( \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x))^{n+1}}{(g(x))^n}\\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x))^{n+3}}{(g(x))^{n+2}}\\,dx \\right) \\\\\n&\\geq \\left(\\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x))^{n+2}}{(g(x))^{n+1}}\\,dx \\right)^2 = I_{n+1}^2.\n\\end{align*}\nIt follows that the sequence $\\{I_{n+1}/I_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ is nondecreasing. Since $I_1/I_0>1$, this implies that $I_{n+1}>I_n$ for all $n$; also,\n$I_n/I_0 = \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (I_{k+1}/I_k) \\geq (I_1/I_0)^n$, and so $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} I_n = \\infty$ since $I_1/I_0>1$ and $I_0 > 0$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nNoam Elkies suggests the following variant of the previous solution,\nwhich eliminates the need to separately check that $I_1 > I_0$.\nFirst, the proof that $I_n I_{n+2} \\geq I_{n+1}^2$ applies also for $n=-1$ under the convention that $I_{-1} = \\int_a^b g(x)\\,dx$ (as in the fourth solution below).\nSecond, this equality must be strict for each $n \\geq -1$: \notherwise, the equality condition in Cauchy--Schwarz would imply that \n$g(x) = c f(x)$ identically for some $c>0$, and the equality $\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = \\int_a^b g(x)\\,dx$ would then force $c=1$, contrary to assumption. Consequently, the sequence $I_{n+1}/I_n$ is strictly increasing; since\n$I_0/I_{-1} = 1$, it follows that for $n \\geq 0$, we again have $I_{n+1}/I_n \\geq I_1/I_0 > 1$ and so on.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\n(from Art of Problem Solving, user \\texttt{MSTang})\nSince $\\int_a^b (f(x) - g(x))\\,dx = 0$,\nwe have\n\\begin{align*}\nI_{n+1} - I_n &= \\int_a^b \\left( \\frac{(f(x))^{n+2}}{(g(x))^{n+1}} - \\frac{(f(x))^{n+1}}{(g(x))^{n}} \\right)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x))^{n+1}}{(g(x))^{n+1}} (f(x)-g(x))\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_a^b \\left(\\frac{(f(x))^{n+1}}{(g(x))^{n+1}} - 1 \\right) (f(x)-g(x))\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x)-g(x))^2 ((f(x))^n + \\cdots + g(x)^n)}{(g(x))^{n+1}}\\,dx.\n\\end{align*}\nThe integrand is continuous, nonnegative, and not identically zero; hence $I_{n+1} - I_n > 0$.\n\nTo prove that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} I_n = \\infty$, note that we cannot have $f(x) \\leq g(x)$ identically, as then\nthe equality $\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = \\int_a^b g(x)\\,dx$ would imply $f(x) = g(x)$ identically. That is, there exists\nsome $t \\in [a,b]$ such that $f(t) > g(t)$. By continuity, there exist a quantity $c > 1$\nand an interval $J = [t_0, t_1]$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(x) \\geq c g(x)$ for all $x \\in J$. We then have\n\\[\nI_n \\geq \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\frac{(f(x))^{n+1}}{(g(x))^n}\\,dx \\\\\n\\geq c^n \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} f(x)\\,dx;\n\\]\nsince $f(x) > 0$ everywhere, we have $\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} f(x)\\,dx > 0$\nand hence $I_n$ is bounded below by a quantity which tends to $\\infty$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nOne can also give a variation of the second half of the solution which shows directly that\n$I_{n+1} - I_n \\geq c^n d$ for some $c > 1, d>0$, thus proving both assertions at once.\n\n%\\textbf{Third solution.}\n%(from Art of Problem Solving, user \\texttt{kybard})\n%Write\n%\\begin{align*}\n%I_n - I_{n-1} &= \\int_a^b (1 + (f(x)-g(x))/g(x))^n (f(x)-g(x))\\,dx \\\\\n%&\\geq (1 + n (f(x)-g(x))/g(x)) (f(x)-g(x))\\,dx \\\\\n%&= n \\int_a^b \\frac{(f(x)-g(x))^2}{g(x)}\\,dx.\n%\\end{align*}\n%The integrand is nonnegative and not identically zero, so\n%$I_n - I_{n-1}$ is bounded below by $n$ times a positive constant. This proves both assertions at once.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\n(from David Savitt, via Art of Problem Solving)\nExtend the definition of $I_n$ to all \\emph{real} $n$,\nand note that \n\\[\nI_{-1} = \\int_a^b g(x)\\,dx = \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = I_0.\n\\]\nBy writing\n\\[\nI_n = \\int_a^b \\exp((n+1)\\log f(x) - n \\log g(x))\\,dx,\n\\]\nwe see that the integrand is a strictly convex function of $n$, as then is $I_n$.\nIt follows that $I_n$ is strictly increasing and unbounded for $n \\geq 1$.\n\n\\textbf{Fourth solution.}\n(by David Rusin)\nAgain, extend the definition of $I_n$ to $n=-1$.\nNow note that for $n \\geq 0$ and $x \\in [a,b]$, we have\n\\[\n(f(x) - g(x)) \\left( \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right)^{n+1}  - \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right)^{n}  \\right) \\geq 0\n\\]\nbecause both factors have the same sign (depending on the comparison between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$);\nmoreover, equality only occurs when $f(x) = g(x)$. Since $f$ and $g$ are not identically equal, we deduce that\n\\[\nI_{n+1} - I_n > I_n - I_{n-1}\n\\]\nand so in particular\n\\[\nI_{n+1} - I_n \\geq I_1 - I_0 > I_0 - I_{-1} = 0.\n\\]\nThis proves both claims.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThis problem appeared in 2005 on an undergraduate math olympiad in Brazil.\nSee \\url{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c7h57686p354392} for discussion."
