A routine calculation now shows that \n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\beta} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\gamma} &=\n6(\\sin(\\alpha) +\\sin(\\beta)+\\sin(\\gamma)-  \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma)) \\\\\n&=\n24\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\beta+\\gamma}{2}\\right)\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\gamma+\\alpha}{2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nHence every critical point of $f$ must satisfy one of $z_1z_2=1$, $z_2z_3=1$, or $z_3z_1=1$. By symmetry, let us assume that $z_1z_2=1$. Then \n\\[\nf = |3-2\\mathrm{Re}(z_1)-z_3|^2-|1-z_3|^2;\n\\]\nsince $3-2\\mathrm{Re}(z_1)\\ge 1$, $f$ is nonnegative and can be zero only if the real part of $z_1$, and hence also $z_1$ itself, is equal to $1$. \n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nIf $z_1 = 1$, we may then apply the same logic to deduce that one of $z_2,z_3,z_4$ is equal to 1. If $z_1 = z_2 = 1$, we may factor the expression\n\\[\n3 - z_1 - z_2 - z_3 - z_4 + z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4\n\\]\nas $(1 - z_3)(1-z_4)$ to deduce that at least three of $z_1, \\dots, z_4$ are equal to $1$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\nWe begin with an ``unsmoothing'' construction.\n\\setcounter{lemma}{0}\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $z_1,z_2,z_3$ be three distinct complex numbers with $|z_j|= 1$ and $z_1 + z_2 + z_3 \\in [0, +\\infty)$. Then there exist another three complex numbers $z'_1, z'_2, z'_3$, not all distinct, with\n$|z'_j| = 1$ and\n\\[\nz'_1 + z'_2 + z'_3 \\in (z_1+ z_2 + z_3, +\\infty), \\quad z_1 z_2 z_3 = z'_1 z'_2 z'_3.\n\\]\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nWrite $z_j = e^{i \\theta_j}$ for $j=1,2,3$. \nWe are then trying to maximize the target function\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta_1 + \\cos \\theta_2 + \\cos \\theta_3\n\\]\ngiven the constraints\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\sin \\theta_1 + \\sin \\theta_2 + \\sin \\theta_3\\\\\n* &= \\theta_1 + \\theta_2 + \\theta_3\n\\end{align*}\nSince $z_1, z_2, z_3$ run over a compact region without boundary, the maximum must be achieved at a point where the matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin \\theta_1 & \\sin \\theta_2 & \\sin \\theta_3 \\\\\n\\cos \\theta_1 & \\cos \\theta_2 & \\cos \\theta_3 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nis singular. Since the determinant of this matrix computes (up to a sign and a factor of 2) the area of the triangle with vertices $z_1, z_2, z_3$,\nit cannot vanish unless some two of $z_1, z_2, z_3$ are equal. This proves the claim.\n\\end{proof}\n\nFor $n$ a positive integer, let $H_n$ be the \\emph{hypocycloid curve} in $\\CC$ given by\n\\[\nH_n = \\{(n-1) z + z^{-n+1}: z \\in \\CC, |z| = 1\\}.\n\\]\nIn geometric terms, $H_n$ is the curve traced out by a marked point on a circle of radius 1 rolling one full circuit along the interior of a circle of radius 1, starting from the point $z=1$.\nNote that the interior of $H_n$ is not convex, but it is \\emph{star-shaped}: it is closed under multiplication by any number in $[0,1]$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor $n$ a positive integer, let $S_n$ be the set of complex numbers of the form $w_1 + \\cdots + w_n$ for some $w_1,\\dots,w_n \\in \\CC$ with\n$|w_j| = 1$ and $w_1 \\cdots w_n = 1$. Then for $n \\leq 4$, $S_n$ is the closed interior of $H_n$ (i.e., including the boundary).\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nBy considering $n$-tuples of the form $(z,\\dots,z,z^{-n+1})$, we see that $H_n \\subseteq S_n$.\nIt thus remains to check that $S_n$ lies in the closed interior of $H_n$.\nWe ignore the easy cases $n=1$ (where $H_1 = S_1 = \\{1\\}$) and $n=2$ (where $H_2 = S_2 = [-2,2]$)\nand assume hereafter that $n \\geq 3$.\n\nBy Lemma 1, for each ray emanating from the the origin, the extreme intersection point of $S_n$ with this ray (which exists because $S_n$ is compact) is achieved by some tuple $(w_1,\\dots,w_n)$ with at most two distinct values.\nFor $n=3$, this immediately implies that this point lies on $H_n$. For $n=4$, we must also consider tuples consisting of two pairs of equal values; however, these only give rise to points in $[-4, 4]$, which are indeed contained in $H_4$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nTurning to the original problem, consider $z_1,\\dots,z_4 \\in \\CC$ with $|z_j| = 1$ and \n\\[\n3 - z_1 - z_2 - z_3 - z_4 + z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 = 0;\n\\]\nwe must prove that at least one $z_j$ is equal to 1.\nLet $z$ be any fourth root of $z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4$,\nput $w_j = z_j/z$, and put $s = w_1 + \\cdots + w_4$. In this notation, we have\n\\[\ns = z^3 + 3z^{-1},\n\\]\nwhere $s \\in S_4$ and $z^3 + 3z^{-1} \\in H_4$. That is, $s$ is a boundary point of $S_4$, so in particular it is the extremal point of $S_4$ on the ray emanating from the origin through $s$.\nBy Lemma 1, this implies that $w_1,\\dots,w_4$ take at most two distinct values. As in the proof of Lemma 2, we distinguish two cases.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nIf $w_1 = w_2 = w_3$, then\n\\[\nw_1^{-3} + 3w_1 = z^3 + 3z^{-1}.\n\\]\nFrom the geometric description of $H_n$, we see that this forces $w_1^{-1} = z$ and hence $z_1 = 1$.\n\n\\item\nIf $w_1 = w_2$ and $w_3 = w_4$, then $s \\in [-4, 4]$ and hence $s = \\pm 4$. This can only be achieved by taking $w_1 = \\cdots = w_4 = \\pm 1$;\nsince $s = z^3 + 3z^{-1}$ we must also have $z = \\pm 1$, yielding $z_1 = \\cdots = z_4 = 1$."
