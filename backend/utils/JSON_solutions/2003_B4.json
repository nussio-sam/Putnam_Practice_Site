The following are also rational:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-b}{a} &= g+h \\\\\n\\frac{c}{a} &= gh + u + v \\\\\n\\frac{-d}{a} &= gv + hu\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the first line, $h$ is rational. From the second line, $u+v$\nis rational. From the third line, $g(u+v) - (gv+hu) =\n(g-h)u$ is rational. Since $g \\neq h$, $u$ is rational, as desired.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:} This solution uses some basic\nGalois theory. We may assume $r_1 \\neq r_2$, since otherwise they are both\nrational and so then is $r_1r_2$.\n\nLet $\\tau$ be an automorphism of the field of algebraic numbers; then $\\tau$\nmaps each $r_i$ to another one, and fixes the rational number $r_1 + r_2$.\nIf $\\tau(r_1)$ equals one of $r_1$ or $r_2$, then $\\tau(r_2)$ must equal\nthe other one, and vice versa.  Thus $\\tau$ either fixes the set $\\{r_1,\nr_2\\}$ or moves it to $\\{r_3, r_4\\}$. But if the latter happened, we would\nhave $r_1 +r_2 = r_3+r_4$, contrary to hypothesis.  Thus $\\tau$ fixes the\nset $\\{r_1, r_2\\}$ and in particular the number $r_1r_2$. Since this is\ntrue for any $\\tau$, $r_1r_2$ must be rational.\n\n\\textbf{Note:} The conclusion fails if we allow\n$r_1 + r_2 = r_3 + r_4$. For\ninstance, take the polynomial $x^4 - 2$ and label its roots so that\n$(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = x^2 - \\sqrt{2}$ and\n$(x-r_3)(x-r_4) = x^2 + \\sqrt{2}$."
