      "content": "For an admissible triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$, number the\n  vertices of $P$ consecutively $v_1,\\dots,v_n$, and let $a_i$ be the\n  number of edges in $\\mathcal{T}$ emanating from $v_i$; note that\n  $a_i \\geq 2$ for all $i$.\n\n  We first claim that $a_1+\\dots+a_n \\leq 4n-6$. Let $V,E,F$ denote\n  the number of vertices, edges, and faces in $\\mathcal{T}$. By\n  Euler's Formula, $(F+1)-E+V=2$ (one must add 1 to the face count for the\n  region exterior to $P$). Each face has three edges, and each edge but the\n  $n$ outside edges belongs to two faces; hence $F = 2E-n$. On the\n  other hand, each edge has two endpoints, and each of the $V-n$\n  internal vertices is an endpoint of at least $6$ edges; hence\n  $a_1+\\dots+a_n+6(V-n) \\leq 2E$. Combining this inequality with the\n  previous two equations gives\n\\begin{align*}\na_1+\\dots+a_n &\\leq 2E+6n-6(1-F+E) \\\\\n&= 4n-6,\n\\end{align*}\nas claimed.\n\nNow set $A_3 = 1$ and $A_n = A_{n-1}+2n-3$ for $n \\geq 4$; we will\nprove by induction on $n$ that $\\mathcal{T}$ has at most $A_n$\ntriangles. For $n=3$, since $a_1+a_2+a_3=6$, $a_1=a_2=a_3=2$ and hence\n$\\mathcal{T}$ consists of just one triangle.\n\nNext assume that an admissible triangulation of an $(n-1)$-gon has at\nmost $A_{n-1}$ triangles, and let $\\mathcal{T}$ be an admissible\ntriangulation of an $n$-gon. If any $a_i = 2$, then we can remove the\ntriangle of $\\mathcal{T}$ containing vertex $v_i$ to obtain an\nadmissible triangulation of an $(n-1)$-gon; then the number of\ntriangles in $\\mathcal{T}$ is at most $A_{n-1}+1 < A_n$ by induction.\nOtherwise, all $a_i \\geq 3$. Now the average of $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ is\nless than $4$, and thus there are more $a_i = 3$ than $a_i \\geq 5$. It\nfollows that there is a sequence of $k$ consecutive vertices in $P$\nwhose degrees are $3,4,4,\\ldots,4,3$ in order, for some $k$ with\n$2\\leq k\\leq n-1$ (possibly $k=2$, in which case there are no degree\n$4$ vertices separating the degree $3$ vertices). If we remove from\n$\\mathcal{T}$ the $2k-1$ triangles which contain at least one of these\nvertices, then we are left with an admissible triangulation of an\n$(n-1)$-gon. It follows that there are at most $A_{n-1}+2k-1 \\leq\nA_{n-1}+2n-3 = A_n$ triangles in $\\mathcal{T}$. This completes the\ninduction step and the proof.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nWe can refine the bound $A_n$ somewhat.\nSupposing that $a_i \\geq 3$ for all\n$i$, the fact that $a_1 + \\cdots + a_n \\leq 4n-6$ implies that there are at least\nsix more indices $i$ with $a_i = 3$ than with $a_i \\geq 5$. Thus there exist\nsix sequences with degrees $3,4,\\dots,4,3$, of total length at most\n$n+6$. We may thus choose a sequence of length $k \\leq \\lfloor \\frac{n}{6}\n\\rfloor + 1$, so we may improve the upper bound to $A_n = A_{n-1} +\n2 \\lfloor \\frac{n}{6} \\rfloor + 1$, or asymptotically\n$\\frac{1}{6} n^2$.\n\nHowever (as noted by Noam Elkies), a hexagonal swatch of a triangular\nlattice, with the boundary as close to regular as possible,\nachieves asymptotically $\\frac{1}{6} n^2$ triangles."
