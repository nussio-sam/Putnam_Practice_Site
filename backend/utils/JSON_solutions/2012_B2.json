      "content": "Fix a face $F$ of the polyhedron with area $A$. Suppose $F$ is completely covered by balls of radii\n$r_1, \\dots, r_n$ whose volumes sum to $V$. Then on one hand,\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r_i^3 = V.\n\\]\nOn the other hand, the intersection of a ball of radius $r$ with the plane containing $F$ is a\ndisc of radius at most $r$, which covers a piece of $F$ of area at most $\\pi r^2$; therefore\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\pi r_i^2 \\geq A.\n\\]\nBy writing $n$ as $\\sum_{i=1}^n 1$ and applying H\\\"older's inequality,\nwe obtain\n\\[\nn V^2 \\geq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r_i^3 \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^3\n\\geq \\frac{16}{9\\pi} A^3.\n\\]\nConsequently, any value of $c(P)$ less than $\\frac{16}{9\\pi} A^3$ works."
