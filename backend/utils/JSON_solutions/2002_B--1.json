This is evident\nfor $n=2$. Given the result for $n$, we see that the probability of\nmaking $i$ shots after $n+1$ attempts is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{i-1}{n} \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\left( 1 - \\frac{i}{n} \\right) \\frac{1}{n-1}\n&= \\frac{(i-1) + (n-i)}{n(n-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n},\n\\end{align*}\nas claimed."
