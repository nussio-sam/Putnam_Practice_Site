We then have\n\\[\n1^{2k-1} + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{2i-1}^{2k-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{2i}^{2k-1} \\qquad (k=1,\\dots,n+1).\n\\]\nBy the lemma, this means that the multisets $\\{1,x_1,x_3,\\dots,x_{2n-1}\\}$ and $\\{x_2,x_4,\\dots,x_{2n}\\}$ become equal after removing pairs of inverses until this becomes impossible. However, of the resulting two multisets, the first contains 1 and the second does not, yielding the desired contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nOne can also prove the lemma using the invertibility of the Vandermonde matrix\n\\[\n(x_i^j)_{i=0,\\dots,n; j=0,\\dots,n}\n\\]\nfor $x_0,\\dots,x_n$ pairwise distinct (this matrix has determinant $\\prod_{0 \\leq i < j \\leq n}(x_i - x_j) \\neq 0$). For a similar argument, see\nProposition 22 of: M. Bhargava, Galois groups of random integer polynomials and van der Waerden's conjecture, arXiv:2111.06507.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe solution for $m=n$ given above is not unique (see below).\nHowever, it does become unique if we add the assumption that $x_i = -x_{2n+1-i}$ for $i=1,\\dots,2n$ (i.e., the set of intervals is symmetric around 0).\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.} (by Evan Dummit)\nDefine the polynomial\n\\[\np(x) = (x-x_1)(x+x_2) \\cdots (x-x_{2n-1})(x+x_{2n})(x+1);\n\\]\nby hypothesis, $p(x)$ has $2n+1$ distinct real roots in the interval $[-1, 1)$. Let $s_k$ denote the $k$-th power sum of $p(x)$; then for any given $m$, the desired condition is that\n$s_{2k-1} = 0$ for $k=1,\\dots,m$.\nLet $e_k$ denote the $k$-th elementary symmetric function of the roots of $p(x)$; that is,\n\\[\np(x) = x^{2n+1} + \\sum_{i=k}^{2n+1} (-1)^k e_k x^{2n+1-k}.\n\\]\nBy the Girard--Newton identities,\n\\[\n(2k-1) e_{2k-1} = s_1 e_{2k-2} - s_2 e_{2k-2} + \\cdots - s_{2k} e_1;\n\\]\nhence the desired condition implies that $e_{2k-1} = 0$ for $k=1,\\dots,m$.\n\nIf we had a solution with $m=n+1$, then the vanishing of $e_1,\\dots,e_{2k+1}$ would imply that $p(x)$ is an odd polynomial (that is, $p(x) = -p(x)$ for all $x$), which in turn would imply that $x=1$ is also a root of $p$. Since we have already identified $2n+1$ other roots of $p$, this yields a contradiction.\n\nBy the same token, a solution with $m=n$ corresponds to a polynomial $p(x)$ of the form $xq(x^2) + a$ for some polynomial $q(x)$ of degree $n$ and some real number $a$ (necessarily equal to $q(1)$). It will thus suffice to choose $q(x)$ so that the resulting polynomial $p(x)$ has roots consisting of $-1$ plus $2n$ distinct values in $(-1,1)$. To do this, start with any polynomial $r(x)$ of degree $n$ with $n$ distinct positive roots (e.g., $r(x) = (x-1)\\cdots(x-n)$). \nThe polynomial $x r(x^2)$ then has $2n+1$ distinct real roots;\nconsequently, for $\\epsilon > 0$ sufficiently small, $xr(x^2) + \\epsilon$ also has $2n+1$ distinct real roots. Let $-\\alpha$ be the smallest of these roots (so that $\\alpha > 0$); we then take $q(x) = r(x\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ to achieve the desired result.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nBrian Lawrence points out that one can also produce solutions for $m=n$ by starting with the degenerate solution\n\\[\n-a_{n-1}, \\ldots, -a_1, 0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, 1\n\\]\n(where $0 < a_1 < \\cdots < a_{n-1} < 1$ but no other conditions are imposed) and deforming it using the implicit function theorem. More\nprecisely, there exists a differentiable parametric solution $x_1(t),\\dots,x_{2n}(t)$ with $x_i(t) = x_{2n-i}(t)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$ specializing to the previous solution at $t=0$,\nsuch that $x_i'(0) \\neq 0$ for $i=n,\\dots,2n$; this is because the Jacobian matrix\n\\[\nJ = ((2k-1) x_i(0)^{2k-2})_{i=n,\\dots,2n; k=1,\\dots,n}\n\\]\n(interpreting $0^0$ as $1$) has the property that every maximal minor is nonzero (these being scaled Vandermonde matrices).\nIn particular we may normalize so that $x_{2n}'(0) < 0$, and then evaluating at a small positive value of $t$ gives the desired example.\n\nIn the proof that $m=n+1$ cannot occur, one can similarly use the implicit function theorem (with some care) to reduce to the case where $\\{|x_1|,\\dots,|x_{2n}|\\}$ has cardinality $n+1$. This can be extended to a complete solution, but the details are rather involved."
