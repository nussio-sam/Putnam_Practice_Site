This yields\n$\\alpha = 1/(2x+1) \\in \\{2/3, 3/2\\}$.\n\nIf $C_1$ does not intersect $L$, then $C_1$ and $C_2$ are separated by $L$\nand so cannot be tangent.\n\nIf $C_1$ intersects $L$ in two distinct points $P_1, P_2$, then it is not\ntangent to $L$ at either point. Suppose at one of these points, say $P_1$,\nthe tangent to $C_1$ is perpendicular to $L$; then by symmetry, the same\nwill be true of $C_2$, so $C_1$ and $C_2$ will be tangent at $P_1$. In this\ncase, the point $P_1 = (x,x)$ satisfies\n\\[\n2 \\alpha x + \\alpha = -1, \\qquad x = \\alpha x^2 + \\alpha x + \\frac{1}{24};\n\\]\nwriting $\\alpha = -1/(2x+1)$ in the first equation and substituting into\nthe second, we have\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{x^2+x}{2x+1} + \\frac{1}{24},\n\\]\nor\n$x = (-23 \\pm \\sqrt{601})/72$.\nThis yields\n$\\alpha = -1/(2x+1) = (13 \\pm \\sqrt{601})/12$.\n\nIf instead the tangents to $C_1$ at $P_1, P_2$ are not perpendicular to\n$L$, then we claim there cannot be any point where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are tangent.\nIndeed, if we count intersections of $C_1$ and $C_2$ (by using $C_1$ to\nsubstitute for $y$ in $C_2$, then solving for $y$), we get at most four\nsolutions counting multiplicity. Two of these are $P_1$ and $P_2$,\nand any point of tangency counts for two more. However, off of $L$,\nany point of tangency would have a mirror image which is also a point of\ntangency, and there cannot be six solutions. Hence we have now found all\npossible $\\alpha$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nFor any nonzero value of $\\alpha$, the two\nconics will intersect in four points in the complex projective plane\n$\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{C})$. To determine the\n$y$-coordinates of these intersection points, subtract the two equations\nto obtain\n\\[\n(y-x) = \\alpha(x-y)(x+y) + \\alpha(x-y).\n\\]\nTherefore, at\na point of intersection we have either $x=y$, or $x = -1/\\alpha - (y+1)$.\nSubstituting these two possible linear conditions into the second\nequation shows that the $y$-coordinate of a point of intersection is a\nroot of either\n$Q_1(y) = \\alpha y^2+(\\alpha-1)y + 1/24$ or\n$Q_2(y) = \\alpha y^2 + (\\alpha+1) y + 25/24 +1/\\alpha$.\n\nIf two curves\nare tangent, then the $y$-coordinates of at least two of the\nintersection points will coincide; the converse is also true because one of the\ncurves is the graph of a function in $x$. The coincidence\noccurs precisely when either\nthe discriminant of at least one of $Q_1$ or $Q_2$ is zero, or\nthere is a common root of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Computing the discriminants of $Q_1$\nand $Q_2$ yields (up to constant factors) $f_1(\\alpha)=6\\alpha^2 -\n13\\alpha + 6$ and $f_2(\\alpha)=6\\alpha^2 - 13\\alpha - 18$, respectively.\nIf on the other hand $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ have a common root, it must\nbe also a root of $Q_2(y) - Q_1(y) = 2y +1 + 1/\\alpha$,\nyielding $y = -(1+\\alpha)/(2\\alpha)$ and\n$0 = Q_1(y) = -f_2(\\alpha)/(24 \\alpha)$.\n\nThus the values of\n$\\alpha$ for which the two curves are tangent must be contained in the\nset of zeros of $f_1$ and $f_2$, namely $2/3$, $3/2$, and\n$(13\\pm\\sqrt{601})/12$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThe fact that the two conics in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\CC)$ meet in four points, counted\nwith multiplicities, is a special case of \\emph{B\\'ezout's theorem}: two\ncurves in $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\CC)$ of degrees $m, n$ and not sharing any common component\nmeet in exactly $mn$ points when counted with multiplicity.\n\nMany solvers were surprised that the proposers chose the parameter $1/24$\nto give two rational roots and two nonrational roots. In fact, they had\nno choice in the matter: attempting to make all four roots rational\nby replacing $1/24$ by $\\beta$ amounts\nto asking for $\\beta^2 + \\beta$ and $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1$ to be perfect\nsquares. This cannot happen outside of trivial cases ($\\beta = 0, -1$)\nultimately because the elliptic curve 24A1 (in Cremona's notation)\nover $\\mathbb{Q}$ has rank $0$. (Thanks to Noam Elkies for providing this\ncomputation.)\n\nHowever, there are choices that make the radical milder,\ne.g., $\\beta = 1/3$  gives\n$\\beta^2 + \\beta = 4/9$ and $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1 = 13/9$,\nwhile $\\beta = 3/5$ gives $\\beta^2 + \\beta = 24/25$\nand $\\beta^2 + \\beta + 1 = 49/25$."
