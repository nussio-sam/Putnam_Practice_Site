      "content": "The possible values of $n$ are 1 and 7.\n\nClearly the set $S = \\{0\\}$ works. Suppose that $S \\neq \\{0\\}$ is a finite set satisfying the given condition; in particular, $S$ does not consist of a collection of collinear vectors, since otherwise $\\{v \\times w: v,w \\in S\\} = \\{0\\}$. We claim that $S$ cannot contain any nonzero vector $v$ with $\\|v\\| \\neq 1$. Suppose otherwise, and let $w \\in S$ be a vector not collinear with $v$. Then $S$ must contain the nonzero vector $u_1 = v\\times w$, as well as the sequence of vectors $u_n$ defined inductively by $u_n = v \\times u_{n-1}$. Since each $u_n$ is orthogonal to $v$ by construction, we have $\\|u_n\\| = \\|v\\| \\|u_{n-1}\\|$ and so $\\|u_n\\| = \\|v\\|^{n-1} \\|u_1\\|$. The sequence $\\|u_n\\|$ consists of all distinct numbers and thus $S$ is infinite, a contradiction. This proves the claim, and so every nonzero vector in $S$ is a unit vector.\n\nNext note that any pair of vectors $v,w \\in S$ must either be collinear or orthogonal: by the claim, $v,w$ are both unit vectors, and if $v,w$ are not collinear then $v\\times w \\in S$ must be a unit vector, whence $v\\perp w$. Now choose any pair of non-collinear vectors $v_1,v_2 \\in S$, and write $v_3 = v_1 \\times v_2$. Then $\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and it follows that all of these vectors are in $S$: $0$, $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $-v_1 = v_3 \\times v_2$, $-v_2 = v_1 \\times v_3$, and $-v_3 = v_2 \\times v_1$. On the other hand, $S$ cannot contain any vector besides these seven, since any other vector $w$ in $S$ would have to be simultaneously orthogonal to all of $v_1,v_2,v_3$.\n\nThus any set $S \\neq \\{0\\}$ satisfying the given condition must be of the form $\\{0,\\pm v_1,\\pm v_2,\\pm v_3\\}$ where $\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It is clear that any set of this form does satisfy the given condition. We conclude that the answer is $n=1$ or $n=7$."
