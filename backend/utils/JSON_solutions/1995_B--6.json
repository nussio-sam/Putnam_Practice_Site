      "content": "Obviously $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ have to be greater than 1, and no\ntwo can both be rational, so without loss of generality assume that\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are irrational.\nLet $\\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denote the fractional part of $x$.\nThen $m \\in S(\\alpha)$ if and only if $f(m/\\alpha) \\in (1-1/\\alpha,1)\n\\cup \\{0\\}$. In particular, this means that $S(\\alpha) \\cap \\{1,\n\\dots, n\\}$ contains $\\lceil (n+1)/\\alpha \\rceil -1$ elements, and\nsimilarly. Hence for every integer $n$,\n\\[\nn = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n+1}\\alpha \\right\\rceil +\n \\left\\lceil \\frac{n+1}\\beta \\right\\rceil +\n \\left\\lceil \\frac{n+1}\\gamma \\right\\rceil -3.\n\\]\nDividing through by $n$ and taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ shows\nthat $1/\\alpha + 1/\\beta + 1/\\gamma = 1$. That in turn implies that\nfor all $n$,\n\\[\n\\left\\{ - \\frac{n+1}{\\alpha} \\right\\} +\n\\left\\{ - \\frac{n+1}{\\beta} \\right\\} +\n\\left\\{ - \\frac{n+1}{\\gamma} \\right\\} = 2.\n\\]\nOur desired contradiction is equivalent to showing that the left side actually\ntakes the value 1 for some $n$. Since the left side is\nan integer, it suffices to show that $\\{ -(n+1)/\\alpha\\} +\n\\{-(n+1)/\\beta\\} < 1$ for some $n$.\n\nA result in ergodic theory (the two-dimensional version of the Weil\nequidistribution theorem) states that if $1,r,s$ are linearly\nindependent over the rationals, then the set of points $(\\{nr\\},\n\\{ns\\}$ is dense (and in fact equidistributed) in the unit square. In\nparticular, our claim definitely holds unless $a/\\alpha + b/\\beta =\nc$ for some integers $a,b,c$.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that such a relation does hold. Since\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are irrational, by the one-dimensional Weil\ntheorem, the set of points $(\\{-n/\\alpha\\}, \\{-n/\\beta\\}$ is dense in\nthe set of $(x,y)$ in the unit square such that $ax + by$ is an integer.\nIt is simple enough to show that this set meets the region $\\{(x,y)\n\\in [0,1]^{2}: x+y<1\\}$ unless $a+b$ is an integer, and that would\nimply that $1/\\alpha + 1/\\beta$, a quantity between 0 and 1, is an\ninteger. We have our desired contradiction."
