      "content": "The series diverges. First note that since $\\sin (x)<x$ for all $x>0$, the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is positive and decreasing, with $a_1=1$. Next, we observe that for $x \\in [0,1]$, $\\sin(x) \\geq x-x^3/6$: this follows from Taylor's theorem with remainder, since $\\sin(x) = x- x^3/6+(\\sin c)x^4/24$ for some $c$ between $0$ and $x$.\n\nWe now claim that $a_n \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}$ for all $n \\geq 1$; it follows that $\\sum a_n^2$ diverges since $\\sum 1/n$ diverges. To prove the claim, we induct on $n$, with $n=1$ being trivial. Suppose that $a_n \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. To prove $\\sin(a_n) \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n+1}$, note that since $\\sin(a_n) \\geq \\sin(1/\\sqrt{n})$, it suffices to prove that $x-x^3/6 \\geq (n+1)^{-1/2}$ where $x=1/\\sqrt{n}$. Squaring both sides and clearing denominators, we find that this is equivalent to $(n+1)(6n-1)^2 \\geq 36n^3$, or $24n^2-11n+1 \\geq 0$. But this last inequality is true since $24n^2-11n+1 = (3n-1)(8n-1)$, and the induction is complete."
