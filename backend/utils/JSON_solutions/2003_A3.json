In this new coordinate,\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2x = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 2y,\n\\]\nand writing $c = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(y) &= (1 + c)\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{c^2 -1} \\right) - 1 \\\\\n&= c + \\frac{2}{c - 1}.\n\\end{align*}\nWe must analyze this function of $c$ in the range $[-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}]$.\nIts value at $c=-\\sqrt{2}$ is $2 - 3\\sqrt{2} < -2.24$, and at\n$c = \\sqrt{2}$ is $2 + 3\\sqrt{2}>6.24$.\nIts derivative is $1 - 2/(c-1)^2$, which vanishes when\n$(c-1)^2 = 2$, i.e., where $c = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$. Only the value\n$c = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$ is in bounds, at which\nthe value of $f$ is $1-2\\sqrt{2} > -1.83$. As for the pole at $c=1$,\nwe observe that $f$ decreases as $c$ approaches from below\n(so takes negative values for all $c<1$) and increases as $c$\napproaches from above (so takes positive values for all $c>1$); from\nthe data collected so far, we see that $f$ has no sign crossings, so\nthe minimum of $|f|$ is achieved at a critical point of $f$.\nWe conclude that the minimum of $|f|$ is $2 \\sqrt{2} - 1$.\n\nAlternate derivation (due to Zuming Feng): We can also minimize $|c + 2/(c-1)|$\nwithout calculus (or worrying about boundary conditions). For $c>1$, we have\n\\[\n1 + (c-1) + \\frac{2}{c-1} \\geq 1 + 2 \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nby AM-GM on the last two terms, with equality for $c-1 = \\sqrt{2}$\n(which is out of range).\nFor $c<1$, we similarly have\n\\[\n-1 + 1-c + \\frac{2}{1-c} \\geq -1 + 2\\sqrt{2},\n\\]\nhere with equality for $1-c = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nWrite\n\\[\nf(a,b) = a+b + \\frac{1}{ab} + \\frac{a+b}{ab}.\n\\]\nThen the problem is to minimize $|f(a,b)|$ subject to the constraint\n$a^2+b^2-1 = 0$. Since the constraint region has no boundary, it is\nenough to check the value at each critical point and each potential\ndiscontinuity (i.e., where $ab=0$) and select the smallest value\n(after checking that $f$ has no sign crossings).\n\nWe locate the critical points using the Lagrange multiplier condition:\nthe gradient of $f$ should be parallel to that of the constraint, which is\nto say, to the vector $(a,b)$. Since\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a}\n= 1 - \\frac{1}{a^2 b} - \\frac{1}{a^2}\n\\]\nand similarly for $b$, the proportionality yields\n\\[\na^2 b^3 - a^3 b^2 + a^3 - b^3 + a^2 - b^2 = 0.\n\\]\nThe irreducible factors of the left side are $1+a$, $1+b$,\n$a-b$, and $ab-a-b$. So we must check what happens when any of\nthose factors, or $a$ or $b$, vanishes.\n\nIf $1+a = 0$, then $b=0$, and the singularity of $f$ becomes removable\nwhen restricted to the circle. Namely, we have\n\\[\nf = a + b + \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{b+1}{ab}\n\\]\nand $a^2+b^2-1 = 0$ implies $(1+b)/a = a/(1-b)$. Thus we have\n$f = -2$; the same occurs when $1+b=0$.\n\nIf $a-b=0$, then $a=b=\\pm \\sqrt{2}/2$ and either\n$f = 2 + 3 \\sqrt{2} > 6.24$, or $f = 2 - 3 \\sqrt{2} < -2.24$.\n\nIf $a=0$, then either $b = -1$ as discussed above, or $b=1$. In the\nlatter case, $f$ blows up as one approaches this point, so there cannot\nbe a global minimum there.\n\nFinally, if $ab-a-b = 0$, then\n\\[\na^2b^2 = (a + b)^2 = 2ab + 1\n\\]\nand so $ab = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$. The plus sign is impossible since\n$|ab| \\leq 1$, so $ab = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$ and\n\\begin{align*}\nf(a,b) &= ab + \\frac{1}{ab} + 1 \\\\\n&= 1 - 2 \\sqrt{2} > -1.83.\n\\end{align*}\nThis yields the smallest value of $|f|$ in the list (and indeed no sign\ncrossings are possible), so $2\\sqrt{2}-1$ is the desired minimum of $|f|$.\n\n\\textbf{Note:} Instead of using the geometry of the graph of $f$ to rule\nout sign crossings, one can verify explicitly that $f$ cannot\ntake the value 0. In the first solution, note that $c + 2/(c-1)=0$\nimplies $c^2 - c + 2 = 0$, which has no real roots.\nIn the second solution, we would have\n\\[\na^2 b + ab^2 + a + b =  -1.\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying yields\n\\[\n2a^3b^3 + 5a^2b^2 + 4ab = 0,\n\\]\nwhose only real root is $ab=0$. But the cases with $ab=0$ do not yield\n$f=0$, as verified above."
