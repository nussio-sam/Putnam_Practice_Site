      "content": "The largest such $k$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$.\nFor $n$ even, this value is achieved by the partition\n\\[\n\\{1, n\\}, \\{2, n-1\\}, \\dots;\n\\]\nfor $n$ odd, it is achieved by the partition\n\\[\n\\{n\\}, \\{1, n-1\\}, \\{2, n-2\\}, \\dots.\n\\]\nOne way to see that this is optimal is to note that the common sum can never be less than $n$,\nsince $n$ itself belongs to one of the boxes. This implies that $k \\leq (1 + \\cdots + n)/n = (n+1)/2$.\nAnother argument is that if $k > (n+1)/2$, then there would have to be two boxes with one number each\n(by the pigeonhole principle), but such boxes could not have the same sum.\n\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} A much subtler question would be to find the smallest $k$ (as a function of $n$)\nfor which no such arrangement exists."
