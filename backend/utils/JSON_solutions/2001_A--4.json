      "content": "Choose $r,s,t$ so that $EC = rBC, FA = sCA, GB = tCB$, and let\n$[XYZ]$ denote the area of triangle $XYZ$. Then $[ABE] = [AFE]$ since\nthe triangles have the same altitude and base.\nAlso $[ABE] = (BE/BC) [ABC] = 1-r$, and\n$[ECF] = (EC/BC)(CF/CA)[ABC] = r(1-s)$ (e.g., by the law of sines).\nAdding this\nall up yields\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= [ABE] + [ABF] + [ECF] \\\\\n&= 2(1-r) + r(1-s) = 2-r-rs\n\\end{align*}\nor $r(1+s) = 1$.\nSimilarly $s(1+t) = t(1+r) = 1$.\n\nLet $f: [0, \\infty) \\to [0, \\infty)$ be the function given by\n$f(x) = 1/(1+x)$; then $f(f(f(r))) = r$.\nHowever, $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing in $x$, so $f(f(x))$ is increasing\nand $f(f(f(x)))$ is decreasing. Thus there is at most one $x$ such that\n$f(f(f(x))) = x$;\nin fact, since the equation $f(z) = z$ has a positive root\n$z = (-1 + \\sqrt{5})/2$, we must have $r=s=t=z$.\n\nWe now compute $[ABF] = (AF/AC) [ABC] = z$,\n$[ABR] = (BR/BF) [ABF] = z/2$, analogously $[BCS] = [CAT] = z/2$, and\n$[RST] = |[ABC] - [ABR] - [BCS] - [CAT]| = |1 - 3z/2| = \\frac{7 - 3\n\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n\nNote: the key relation $r(1+s) = 1$ can also be derived by computing\nusing homogeneous coordinates or vectors."
