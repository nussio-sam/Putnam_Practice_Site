      "content": "For notational convenience, we will interpret the problem as\nallowing the empty subsequence, whose product is the identity element of\nthe group. To solve the problem in the interpretation where the empty\nsubsequence is not allowed, simply append the identity element to the sequence\ngiven by one of the following solutions.\n\n\\textbf{First solution:}\nPut $n = |G|$.\nWe will say that a sequence $S$ \\emph{produces}\nan element $g \\in G$ if $g$ occurs as the product of some subsequence\nof $S$.\nLet $H$ be the set of elements produced by the sequence $S$.\n\nStart with $S$ equal to the empty sequence. If at any point\nthe set $H^{-1}H = \\{h_1 h_2: h_1^{-1}, h_2 \\in H\\}$ fails to be\nall of $G$, extend $S$ by appending an element $g$ of $G$ not in\n$H^{-1} H$. Then $Hg \\cap H$ must be empty, otherwise there would\nbe an equation of the form $h_1 g= h_2 $ with $h_1, h_2 \\in G$,\nor $g = h_1^{-1} h_2$, a contradiction. Thus we can extend $S$ by one\nelement and double the size of $H$.\n\nAfter $k \\leq \\log_2 n$ steps, we must obtain a sequence $S\n= a_1,\\dots,a_k$ for which $H^{-1} H = G$. Then\nthe sequence $a_k^{-1}, \\dots, a_1^{-1}, a_1, \\dots, a_k$\nproduces all of $G$ and has length at most $(2/\\ln 2) \\ln n$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n\nPut $m = |H|$. We will show that we can append one element\n$g$ to $S$ so that the resulting sequence of $k+1$ elements will produce\nat least $2m-m^2/n$ elements of $G$. To see this, we compute\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{g \\in G} |H \\cup Hg|\n&= \\sum_{g \\in G} (|H| + |Hg| - |H \\cap Hg|) \\\\\n&= 2mn - \\sum_{g \\in G} |H \\cap Hg| \\\\\n&= 2mn - |\\{(g,h) \\in G^2: h \\in H \\cap Hg\\}| \\\\\n&= 2mn - \\sum_{h \\in H} |\\{g \\in G: h \\in Hg\\}| \\\\\n&= 2mn - \\sum_{h \\in H} |H^{-1} h| \\\\\n&= 2mn - m^2.\n\\end{align*}\nBy the pigeonhole principle, we have $|H \\cup Hg| \\geq 2m - m^2/n$ for\nsome choice of $g$, as claimed.\n\nIn other words, by extending the sequence by one element,\nwe can replace the ratio $s = 1-m/n$ (i.e., the fraction\nof elements of $G$ not generated by $S$)\nby a quantity no greater than\n\\[\n1-(2m-m^2/n)/n = s^2.\n\\]\nWe start out with $k = 0$ and $s = 1 - 1/n$;\nafter $k$ steps, we have $s \\leq (1-1/n)^{2^k}$.\nIt is enough to prove that for some $c > 0$, we can always find\nan integer $k \\leq c \\ln n$ such that\n\\[\n\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^{2^k} < \\frac{1}{n},\n\\]\nas then we have $n-m < 1$ and hence $H = G$.\n\nTo obtain this last inequality, put\n\\[\nk = \\lfloor 2 \\log_2 n \\rfloor < (2/\\ln 2) \\ln n,\n\\]\nso that $2^{k+1} \\geq n^2$.\nFrom the facts that $\\ln n \\leq \\ln 2 + (n-2)/2 \\leq n/2$ and\n$\\ln (1-1/n) < -1/n$ for all $n \\geq 2$, we have\n\\[\n2^k \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\right) < -\\frac{n^2}{2n} =  -\\frac{n}{2} < -\\ln n,\n\\]\nyielding the desired inequality.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:} An alternate approach in the second solution\nis to distinguish betwen the cases of $H$ small (i.e.,\n$m < n^{1/2}$, in which case $m$ can be replaced by a value\nno less than $2m-1$) and $H$ large.\nThis strategy is used in a number of recent results\nof Bourgain, Tao, Helfgott, and others on \\emph{small doubling}\nor \\emph{small tripling}\nof subsets of finite groups.\n\nIn the second solution, if we avoid the rather weak inequality\n$\\ln n \\leq n/2$, we instead get sequences of length\n$\\log_2 (n \\ln n) = \\log_2(n) + \\log_2 (\\ln n)$.\nThis is close to optimal: one cannot use fewer than $\\log_2 n$\nterms because the number of subsequences must be at least $n$."
