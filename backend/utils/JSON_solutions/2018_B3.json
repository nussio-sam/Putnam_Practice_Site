      "content": "The values of $n$ with this property are $2^{2^\\ell}$ for $\\ell = 1,2,4,8$.\nFirst, note that $n$ divides $2^n$ if and only if $n$ is itself a power of 2; we may thus write $n = 2^m$ and note that\nif $n<10^{100}$, then\n\\[\n2^m = n < 10^{100} < (10^3)^{34} < (2^{10})^{34} = 2^{340}.\n\\]\nMoreover, the case $m=0$ does not lead to a solution because for $n=1$, $n-1 = 0$ does not divide $2^n-1 = 1$; we \nmay thus assume $1 \\leq m \\leq 340$.\n\nNext, note that modulo $n-1 = 2^m-1$, the powers of $2$ cycle with period $m$ (the terms\n$2^0, \\dots, 2^{m-1}$ remain the same upon reduction, and then the next term repeats the initial 1); consequently,\n$n-1$ divides $2^n-1$ if and only if $m$ divides $n$, which happens if and only if $m$ is a power of 2.\nWrite $m = 2^\\ell$ and note that $2^\\ell < 340 < 512$, so $\\ell < 9$. The case $\\ell=0$ does not lead to a solution because for $n=2$, $n-2 =0$ does not divide $2^n-2 = 2$; we may thus assume $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 8$.\n\nFinally, note that $n-2 = 2^m-2$ divides $2^n-2$ if and only if $2^{m-1} - 1$ divides $2^{n-1} - 1$.\nBy the same logic as the previous paragraph, this happens if and only if $m-1$ divides $n-1$,\nthat is, if $2^\\ell - 1$ divides $2^m-1$. This in turn happens if and only if $\\ell$ divides $m = 2^\\ell$,\nwhich happens if and only if $\\ell$ is a power of 2. The values allowed by the bound $\\ell < 9$ are\n$\\ell = 1,2,4,8$; for these values, $m \\leq 2^8 = 256$ and\n\\[\nn = 2^m \\leq 2^{256} \\leq (2^3)^{86} < 10^{86} < 10^{100},\n\\]\nso the solutions listed do satisfy the original inequality."
