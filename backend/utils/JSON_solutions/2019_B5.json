We will show that $p(2N+3) = F_{2N+3}-F_{N+2}$. \n\nDefine a sequence of polynomials $p_0(x),\\ldots,p_N(x)$ by $p_0(x) = p(x)$ and $p_k(x) = p_{k-1}(x)-p_{k-1}(x+2)$ for $k \\geq 1$. Then by induction on $k$, it is the case that $p_k(2n+1) = F_{2n+1+k}$ for $0 \\leq n \\leq N-k$, and also that $p_k$ has degree (at most) $N-k$ for $k \\geq 1$. Thus $p_N(x) = F_{N+1}$ since $p_N(1) = F_{N+1}$ and $p_N$ is constant.\n\n\nWe now claim that for $0\\leq k\\leq N$, $p_{N-k}(2k+3) = \\sum_{j=0}^k F_{N+1+j}$. We prove this again by induction on $k$: for the induction step, we have\n\\begin{align*}\np_{N-k}(2k+3) &= p_{N-k}(2k+1)+p_{N-k+1}(2k+1) \\\\\n&= F_{N+1+k}+\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} F_{N+1+j}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus we have $p(2N+3) = p_0(2N+3) = \\sum_{j=0}^N F_{N+1+j}$. \n\nNow one final induction shows that $\\sum_{j=1}^m F_j = F_{m+2}-1$, and so $p(2N+3) = F_{2N+3}-F_{N+2}$, as claimed. In the case $N=1008$, we thus have $p(2019) = F_{2019} - F_{1010}$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Solution 2.}\nThis solution uses the \\emph{Lagrange interpolation formula}: given $x_0,\\dots,x_n$ and $y_0,\\dots,y_n$, the unique polynomial $P$ of degree at most $n$ satisfying $P(x_i) = y_i$ for $i=0,\\dots,n$ is\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^n P(x_i) \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j} =\n\\]\nWrite \n\\[\nF_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(\\alpha^n - \\beta^{-n}), \\qquad \\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\beta = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\]\nFor $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let $p_\\gamma(x)$ be the unique polynomial of degree at most 1008 satisfying\n\\[\np_1(2n+1) = \\gamma^{2n+1}, p_2(2n+1) = \\gamma^{2n+1} \\, (n=0,\\dots,1008);\n\\]\nthen $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(p_\\alpha(x) - p_\\beta(x))$.\n\nBy Lagrange interpolation,\n\\begin{align*}\np_\\gamma(2019) &= \\sum_{n=0}^{1008} \\gamma^{2n+1} \\prod_{0 \\leq j \\leq 1008, j \\neq n} \\frac{2019-(2j+1)}{(2n+1)-(2j+1)}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{1008} \\gamma^{2n+1} \\prod_{0 \\leq j \\leq 1008, j \\neq n} \\frac{1009-j}{n-j}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=0}^{1008} \\gamma^{2n+1} (-1)^{1008-n} \\binom{1009}{n} \\\\\n&= -\\gamma ((\\gamma^2-1)^{1009} - (\\gamma^2)^{1009}).\n\\end{align*}\nFor $\\gamma \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$ we have $\\gamma^2 = \\gamma + 1$ and so\n\\[\np_\\gamma(2019) = \\gamma^{2019} - \\gamma^{1010}.\n\\]\nWe thus deduce that $p(x) = F_{2019} - F_{1010}$ as claimed.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nKarl Mahlburg suggests the following variant of this. As above, use Lagrange interpolation to write\n\\[\np(2019) = \\sum_{j=0}^{1008} \\binom{1009}{j} F_j;\n\\]\nit will thus suffice to verify (by substiting $j \\mapsto 1009-j$) that\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{1009} \\binom{1009}{j} F_{j+1} = F_{2019}.\n\\]\nThis identity has the following combinatorial interpretation. Recall that $F_{n+1}$ counts the number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ rectangle with $1 \\times 1$ squares and $1 \\times 2$ dominoes (see below). In any such tiling with $n = 2018$, let $j$ be the number of squares among the first 1009 tiles.\nThese can be ordered in $\\binom{1009}{j}$ ways, and the remaining $2018 - j - 2(1009-j) = j$ squares can be\ntiled in $F_{j+1}$ ways.\n\nAs an aside, this interpretation of $F_{n+1}$ is the oldest known interpretation of the Fibonacci sequence,\nlong predating Fibonacci himself. In ancient Sanskrit, syllables were classified as long or short, and a long syllable was considered to be twice as long as a short syllable; consequently, the number of syllable patterns of total length $n$ equals $F_{n+1}$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nIt is not difficult to show that the solution $(j,k) = (2019, 2010)$ is unique (in positive integers). \nFirst, note that to have $F_j - F_k > 0$, we must have $k < j$.\nIf $j < 2019$, then\n\\[\nF_{2019} - F_{1010} = F_{2018} + F_{2017} - F_{1010} > F_{j} > F_j - F_k.\n\\]\nIf $j > 2020$, then  \n\\[\nF_j - F_k \\geq F_j - F_{j-1} = F_{j-2} \\geq F_{2019} > F_{2019} - F_{1010}.\n\\]\nSince $j = 2019$ obviously forces $k = 1010$, the only other possible solution would be with $j = 2020$.\nBut then\n\\[\n(F_j - F_k) - (F_{2019} - F_{1010})\n= (F_{2018} - F_k) + F_{1010} \n\\]\nwhich is negative for $k=2019$ (it equals $F_{1010} - F_{2017}$)\nand positive for $k \\leq 2018$."
