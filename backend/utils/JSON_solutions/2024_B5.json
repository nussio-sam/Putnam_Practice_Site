Consequently, $f_{k,m}(x)$ can be written as $x(x+1)\\cdots(x+m) Q(x)$ for some polynomial $Q(x)$ of degree $k$, and it will suffice to check that $Q(x)$ has $k$ distinct negative real roots.\n\nFrom the equality $f_{k,m}(n) - f_{k,m}(n-1) = R(n,k)R(n,m)$, if we substitute in for $Q(x)$\nand divide out common factors, we obtain\n\\[\n(x+m) Q(x) - (x-1) Q(x-1) = \\frac{1}{m!} R(x,k).\n\\]\nSubstituting $x=0,-1,\\dots,-k+1$ in turn, we obtain\n\\[\nQ(-j) = - \\frac{j+1}{m-j} Q(-j-1) \\quad (j=0, \\dots, k-1).\n\\]\nIn particular, if any of $Q(0),\\dots,Q(-k)$ were zero, then all of them would be zero and \n$Q$ would have too many roots for its degree. Consequently, $Q(0),\\dots,Q(-k)$ are all nonzero\nand alternating in sign. By the intermediate value theorem, $Q$ has a root $r_j$ in the interval $(-j-1,-j)$ for $j=0,\\dots,k-1$; this completes the proof."
