      "content": "Yes, it does follow. Let $P$ be any point in the plane. Let $ABCD$ be any square with center $P$.\nLet $E,F,G,H$ be the midpoints of the segments $AB, BC, CD, DA$, respectively. The function\n$f$ must satisfy the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= f(A) + f(B) + f(C) + f(D) \\\\\n0 &= f(E) + f(F) + f(G) + f(H) \\\\\n0 &= f(A) + f(E) + f(P) + f(H) \\\\\n0 &= f(B) + f(F) + f(P) + f(E) \\\\\n0 &= f(C) + f(G) + f(P) + f(F) \\\\\n0 &= f(D) + f(H) + f(P) + f(G).\n\\end{align*}\nIf we add the last four equations, then subtract the first equation and twice the second equation,\nwe obtain $0 = 4f(P)$, whence $f(P) = 0$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} Problem 1 of the 1996 Romanian IMO team selection exam asks the same\nquestion with squares replaced by regular polygons of any (fixed) number of vertices."
