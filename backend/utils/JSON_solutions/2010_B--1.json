If it did, then the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality would imply\n\\begin{align*}\n8 &= (a_1^2 + a_2^2 +  \\cdots)(a_1^4 + a_2^4 + \\cdots) \\\\\n&\\geq (a_1^3 + a_2^3 + \\cdots)^2 = 9,\n\\end{align*}\ncontradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\n(Communicated by Catalin Zara.)\nSuppose that such a sequence exists.\nIf $a_k^2 \\in [0,1]$ for all $k$, then $a_k^4 \\leq a_k^2$ for all $k$, and so\n\\[\n4 = a_1^4 + a_2^4 + \\cdots \\leq a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots = 2,\n\\]\ncontradiction. There thus exists a positive integer $k$ for which $a_k^2 \\geq 1$.\nHowever, in this case, for $m$ large, $a_k^{2m} > 2m$ and so\n$a_1^{2m} + a_2^{2m} + \\cdots \\neq 2m$.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\nWe generalize the second solution to show that for any positive integer $k$, it is impossible for a sequence\n$a_1, a_2,\\dots$ of complex numbers to satisfy the given conditions in case\nthe series $a_1^k + a_2^k + \\cdots$ converges absolutely. This includes the original problem by taking\n$k=2$, in which case the series $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots$ consists of nonnegative\nreal numbers and so converges absolutely if it converges at all.\n\nSince the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty |a_i|^k$ converges by hypothesis, we can find a positive integer $n$\nsuch that $\\sum_{i=n+1}^\\infty |a_i|^k < 1$. For each positive integer $d$, we then have\n\\[\n\\left|kd - \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{kd} \\right|\n\\leq \\sum_{i=n+1}^\\infty |a_i|^{kd} < 1.\n\\]\nWe thus cannot have $|a_1|,\\dots,|a_n| \\leq 1$, or else the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{kd}$ would be bounded\nin absolute value by $n$ independently of $d$. But if we put $r = \\max\\{|a_1|,\\dots,|a_n|\\} > 1$, we\nobtain another contradiction because for any $\\epsilon > 0$,\n\\[\n\\limsup_{d \\to \\infty} (r-\\epsilon)^{-kd} \\left| \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{kd} \\right| > 0.\n\\]\nFor instance, this follows from applying the root test to the rational function\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{1 - a_i^k z} = \\sum_{d=0}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{kd} \\right) z^d,\n\\]\nwhich has a pole within the circle $|z| \\leq r^{-1/k}$.\n(An elementary proof is also possible.)\n\n\\textbf{Fourth solution.}\n(Communicated by Noam Elkies.)\nSince $\\sum_k a_k^2 = 2$, for each positive integer $k$ we have $a_k^2 \\leq 2$ and so $a_k^4 \\leq 2 a_k^2$,\nwith equality only for $a_k^2 \\in \\{0,2\\}$. Thus to have $\\sum_k a_k^4 = 4$, there must be a single index\n$k$ for which $a_k^2 = 2$, and the other $a_k$ must all equal 0. But then $\\sum_k a_k^{2m} = 2^m \\neq 2m$\nfor any positive integer $m>2$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} Manjul Bhargava points out it is easy to construct sequences of complex numbers with the\ndesired property if we drop the condition of absolute convergence. Here is an inductive construction\n(of which several variants are possible).\nFor $n=1,2,\\dots$ and $z \\in \\CC$, define the finite sequence\n\\[\ns_{n,z} = \\left( \\frac{1}{z} e^{2 \\pi i j/n}: j = 0, \\dots, n-1 \\right).\n\\]\nThis sequence has the property that for any positive integer $j$, the sum of the $j$-th powers\nof the terms of $s_{n,z}$ equals $1/z^{j}$ if $j$ is divisible by $n$ and 0 otherwise.\nMoreover, any partial sum of $j$-th powers is bounded in absolute value by $n/|z|^j$.\n\nThe desired sequence will be constructed as follows. Suppose that we have a finite sequence\nwhich has the correct sum of $j$-th powers for $j=1,\\dots,m$. (For instance, for $m=1$,\nwe may start with the singleton sequence 1.) We may then extend it to a new sequence which has\nthe correct sum of $j$-th powers for $j=1,\\dots,m+1$, by appending $k$ copies of $s_{m+1,z}$\nfor suitable choices of a positive integer $k$ and a complex number $z$ with $|z| < m^{-2}$.\nThis last restriction ensures that the resulting infinite sequence $a_1,a_2,\\dots$ is such that\nfor each positive integer $m$, the series $a_1^m + a_2^m + \\cdots$ is convergent (though not absolutely\nconvergent). Its partial sums include a subsequence equal to the constant value $m$, so the sum of the series\nmust equal $m$ as desired."
