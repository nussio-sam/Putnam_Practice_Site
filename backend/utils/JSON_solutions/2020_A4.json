      "content": "The answer is $1/e$. We first establish a recurrence for $w(N)$. Number the squares $1$ to $N+2$ from left to right. There are $2(N-1)$ equally likely events leading to the first new square being colored black: either we choose one of squares $3,\\ldots,N+1$ and color the square to its left, or we choose one of squares $2,\\ldots,N$ and color the square to its right. Thus the probability of square $i$ being the first new square colored black is $\\frac{1}{2(N-1)}$ if $i=2$ or $i=N+1$ and $\\frac{1}{N-1}$ if $3\\leq i\\leq N$. Once we have changed the first square $i$ from white to black, then the strip divides into two separate systems, squares $1$ through $i$ and squares $i$ through $N+2$, each with first and last square black and the rest white, and we can view the remaining process as continuing independently for each system. Thus if square $i$ is the first square to change color, the expected number of white squares at the end of the process is $w(i-2)+w(N+1-i)$. It follows that\n\\begin{align*}\nw(N) &= \\frac{1}{2(N-1)}(w(0)+w(N-1))+\\\\\n&\\quad \\frac{1}{N-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=3}^N (w(i-2)+w(N+1-i))\\right) \\\\\n&\\quad + \\frac{1}{2(N-1)}(w(N-1)+w(0))\n\\end{align*}\nand so \n\\[\n(N-1)w(N) = 2(w(1)+\\cdots+w(N-2))+w(N-1). \n\\]\nIf we replace $N$ by $N-1$ in this equation and subtract from the original equation, then we obtain the recurrence\n\\[\nw(N) = w(N-1)+\\frac{w(N-2)}{N-1}.\n\\]\n\nWe now claim that $w(N) = (N+1) \\sum_{k=0}^{N+1} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$ for $N\\geq 0$. To prove this, we induct on $N$. The formula holds for $N=0$ and $N=1$ by inspection: $w(0)=0$ and $w(1)=1$. Now suppose that $N\\geq 2$ and $w(N-1) = N\\sum_{k=0}^N \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$, $w(N-2)=(N-1)\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$. Then\n\\begin{align*}\nw(N) &= w(N-1)+\\frac{w(N-2)}{N-1} \\\\\n&= N \\sum_{k=0}^N \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \\\\\n& = (N+1) \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}+\\frac{N(-1)^N}{N!}\\\\\n&= (N+1) \\sum_{k=0}^{N+1} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\n\\end{align*}\nand the induction is complete.\n\nFinally, we compute that \n\\begin{align*}\n\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{w(N)}{N} &= \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{w(N)}{N+1} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} = \\frac{1}{e}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nAoPS user pieater314159 suggests the following alternate description of $w(N)$. Consider the numbers $\\{1,\\dots,N+1\\}$ all originally colored white.\nChoose a permutation $\\pi \\in S_{N+1}$ uniformly at random. For $i=1,\\dots,N+1$ in succession, color $\\pi(i)$ black in case $\\pi(i+1)$ is currently white (regarding $i+1$ modulo $N+1$). After this, the expected number of white squares remaining is $w(N)$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nAndrew Bernoff reports that this problem was inspired by a similar question of Jordan Ellenberg (disseminated via Twitter), which in turn was inspired by the final question of the 2017 MATHCOUNTS competition.
