      "content": "\\textbf{First solution:}\nThe angle at a vertex $P$ is acute if and only if all of the other points\nlie on an open semicircle. We first deduce from this that if there are any\ntwo acute angles at all, they must occur consecutively. Suppose the contrary;\nlabel the vertices $Q_1, \\dots, Q_n$ in counterclockwise order (starting anywhere),\nand suppose that the angles at $Q_1$ and $Q_i$ are acute for some $i$\nwith $3 \\leq i \\leq n-1$.\nThen the open semicircle starting at $Q_2$ and proceeding counterclockwise\nmust contain all of $Q_3, \\dots, Q_n$, while the open semicircle starting at\n$Q_i$ and proceeding counterclockwise must contain $Q_{i+1}, \\dots,\nQ_n, Q_1, \\dots, Q_{i-1}$. Thus two open semicircles cover the entire circle,\ncontradiction.\n\nIt follows that if the polygon has at least one acute angle, then\nit has either one acute angle or two acute angles\noccurring consecutively. In particular, there\nis a unique pair of consecutive vertices $Q_1, Q_2$ in counterclockwise order\nfor which $\\angle Q_2$ is acute and $\\angle Q_1$ is not acute.\nThen the remaining points all lie in the arc from the antipode of $Q_1$\nto $Q_1$, but $Q_2$ cannot lie in the arc, and the remaining points\ncannot all lie in the arc from the antipode of $Q_1$ to the antipode\nof $Q_2$. Given the choice of $Q_1, Q_2$, let $x$ be the measure of\nthe counterclockwise arc from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$; then the probability that\nthe other points fall into position is\n$2^{-n+2} - x^{n-2}$ if $x \\leq 1/2$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nHence the probability that the polygon has at least one acute angle with\na \\emph{given} choice of which two points will act as $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ is\n\\[\n\\int_0^{1/2} (2^{-n+2} - x^{n-2})\\,dx\n= \\frac{n-2}{n-1} 2^{-n+1}.\n\\]\nSince there are $n(n-1)$ choices for which two points act as $Q_1$ and $Q_2$,\nthe probability of at least one acute angle is $n(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by Calvin Lin)\nAs in the first solution, we may compute the probability that for a\nparticular one of the points $Q_1$, the angle at $Q_1$ is not acute but\nthe following angle is, and then multiply by $n$.\nImagine picking the points by first choosing $Q_1$, then\npicking $n-1$ \\emph{pairs}\nof antipodal points and then picking one\nmember of each pair. Let $R_2, \\dots, R_n$ be the points of the pairs\nwhich lie in the semicircle, taken in order away from $Q_1$,\nand let $S_2, \\dots, S_n$ be the antipodes of these. Then to\nget the desired situation,\nwe must choose from the pairs to end up with all but one of the\n$S_i$, and we cannot take $R_n$ and the other $S_i$ or else $\\angle Q_1$ will be\nacute. That gives us $(n-2)$ good choices out of $2^{n-1}$; since we could\nhave chosen $Q_1$ to be any of the $n$ points, the probability is again\n$n(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$."
