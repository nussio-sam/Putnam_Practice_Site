If $S$ consists of all other natural numbers, then $S$ satisfies the given conditions: note that the only perfect squares not in $S$ are $1$ and numbers of the form $(5k)^2$ for some positive integer $k$, and it readily follows that both (b) and (c) hold.\n\n\nNow suppose that $T$ is another set of positive integers satisfying (a), (b), and (c). Note from (b) and (c) that if $n \\in T$ then $n+5 \\in T$, and so $T$ satisfies the following property: \n\\begin{itemize}"
