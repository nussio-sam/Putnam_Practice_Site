Since we assumed that $g,h$ generate $G$,\nwe now conclude that $S = G$, as claimed.\n\nTo complete the proof, we must now check that for each $s \\in G$, the smallest possible length of a representation of $s$ cannot exceed $|G|$. Suppose the contrary, and let\n\\[\ns = g^{m_1} h^{n_1} \\cdots g^{m_r} h^{n_r}\n\\]\nbe a representation of the smallest possible length. Set\n\\[\ns_i = g^{m_1} h^{n_1} \\cdots g^{m_i} h^{n_i} \\qquad (i=0,\\dots,r-1),\n\\]\ninterpreting $s_0$ as $e$; since $r>|G|$ by hypothesis, by the pigeonhole principle there must exist indices $0 \\leq i < j \\leq r-1$ such that $s_i = s_j$. Then\n\\[\ns = g^{m_1} h^{n_1} \\cdots g^{m_i} h^{n_i} g^{m_{j+1}} h^{n_{j+1}} \\cdots g^{m_r} h^{n_r} \n\\]\nis another representation of $s$ of length strictly less than $r$, a contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIf one considers $s_1,\\dots,s_r$ instead of $s_0,\\dots,s_{r-1}$, then the case $s=e$ must be handled separately: otherwise, one might end up with a representation of length 0 which is disallowed by the problem statement.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Reinterpretation:} \nNote that the elements $gh, gh^{-1}, g^{-1} h, g^{-1} h^{-1}$ generate $gh(g^{-1}h)^{-1} = g^2$ and hence all of $G$ (again using the hypothesis that $g$ has odd order, as above). Form the Cayley digraph on the set $G$, i.e., the directed graph with an edge from $s_1$ to $s_2$ whenever $s_2 = s_1 *$ for $* \\in \\{gh, gh^{-1}, g^{-1} h, g^{-1} h^{-1}\\}$. Since $G$ is finite, this digraph is strongly connected: there exists at least one path from any vertex to any other vertex (traveling all edges in the correct direction). The shortest such path cannot repeat any vertices (except the starting and ending vertices in case they coincide), and so has length at most $|G|$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nFor $r$ a positive integer, let $S_r$ be the set of $s \\in G$ which admit a representation of length at most $r$ (terminology as in the first solution); obviously $S_r \\subseteq S_{r+1}$.\nWe will show that $S_r \\neq S_{r+1}$ unless $S_r = G$; this will imply by induction on $r$ that $\\#S_r \\geq \\min\\{r, |G|\\}$ and hence that $S_r = G$ for some $r \\leq |G|$.\n\nSuppose that $S_r = S_{r+1}$.\nThen the map $s \\mapsto sgh$ defines an injective map $S_r \\to S_{r+1} = S_r$,\nso $S_r$ is closed under right multiplication by $gh$. By the same token, $S_r$ is closed under right multiplication by each of $gh^{-1}, g^{-1}h, g^{-1}h^{-1}$.\nSince $gh, gh^{-1}, g^{-1}h, g^{-1}h^{-1}$ generate $G$ as in the first solution, it follows that $S_r = G$ as claimed.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:} The condition on the order of $g$ is needed to rule out the case where $G$ admits a (necessarily normal) subgroup $H$ of index 2 not containing either $g$ or $h$; in this case, all products of the indicated form belong to $H$.\nOn the other hand, if one assumes that both $g$ and $h$ have odd order, then one can say a bit more: there exists some positive integer $r$ with $1 \\leq r \\leq |G|$ such that every element of $G$ has a representation of length exactly $r$. (Namely, the set of such elements for a given $r$ strictly increases in size until it is stable under right multiplication by both\n$gh(g^{-1}h)^{-1} = g^2$ and $gh(gh^{-1})^{-1} = gh^2g^{-1}$, but under the present hypotheses these generate $G$.)"
