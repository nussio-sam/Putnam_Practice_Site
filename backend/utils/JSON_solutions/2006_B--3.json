This suffices\nto imply the maximum in all configurations: given a maximal configuration,\nwe may vary the points slightly to get another maximal configuration in which\nour hypothesis is satisfied.\nFor convenience, we assume $n \\geq 3$, as the cases $n=1,2$ are easy.\n\nLet $P$ be the line at infinity in the real projective plane; i.e., $P$\nis the set of possible directions of lines in the plane, viewed as a circle.\nRemove the directions corresponding to lines through two points of $S$;\nthis leaves behind $\\binom{n}{2}$ intervals.\n\nGiven a direction in one of the intervals, consider the set of linear\npartitions achieved by lines parallel to that direction. Note that the\nresulting collection of partitions depends only on the interval. Then\nnote that the collections associated to adjacent intervals differ in only\none element.\n\nThe trivial partition that puts all of $S$ on one side is in every such\ncollection. We now observe that for any other linear partition\n$\\{A,B\\}$, the set of intervals to which $\\{A,B\\}$ is:\n\\begin{enumerate}"
