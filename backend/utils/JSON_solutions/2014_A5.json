      "content": "\\textbf{First solution:}\nSuppose to the contrary that there exist positive integers $i \\neq j$ and a complex number $z$ such that $P_i(z) = P_j(z) = 0$. Note that $z$ cannot be a nonnegative real number or else $P_i(z), P_j(z) > 0$; we may put $w = z^{-1} \\neq 0,1$. For $n \\in \\{i+1,j+1\\}$ we compute that\n\\[\nw^n = n w - n + 1,\n\\qquad \\overline{w}^n =  n \\overline{w} - n + 1;\n\\]\nnote crucially that these equations also hold for $n \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nTherefore, the function $f: [0, +\\infty) \\to \\RR$ given by\n\\[\nf(t) = \\left| w \\right|^{2t} - t^2 \\left| w \\right|^2 + 2t(t-1)\\mathrm{Re}(w) - (t-1)^2\n\\]\nsatisfies $f(t) = 0$ for $t \\in \\{0,1,i+1,j+1\\}$. On the other hand, for all $t \\geq 0$ we have\n\\[\nf'''(t) = (2 \\log \\left| w \\right|)^3 \\left| w \\right|^{2t} > 0,\n\\]\nso by Rolle's theorem, the equation $f^{(3-k)}(t) = 0$ has at most $k$ distinct solutions for $k=0,1,2,3$. This yields the desired contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nBy similar reasoning, an equation of the form $e^{x} = P(x)$ in which $P$ is a real polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d+1$ real solutions. This turns out to be closely related to a concept in mathematical logic known as \\emph{o-minimality}, which in turn has deep consequences for the solution of Diophantine equations.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n\\setcounter{lemma}{0}\n(by Noam Elkies)\nWe recall a result commonly known as the \\emph{Enestr\\\"om-Kakeya theorem}.\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet \n\\[\nf(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n\n\\]\nbe a polynomial with real coefficients such that $0 < a_0 \\leq a_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_n$.\nThen every root $z \\in \\CC$ of $f$ satisfies $|z| \\leq 1$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $f(z) = 0$, then we may rearrange the equality $0 = f(z)(z-1)$ to obtain\n\\[\na_n z^{n+1} = (a_n - a_{n-1}) z^n + \\cdots + (a_1 - a_0)z + a_0.\n\\]\nBut if $|z| > 1$, then \n\\[\n|a_n z^{n+1}| \\leq (|a_n - a_{n-1}| + \\cdots + |a_1 - a_0|) |z|^{n}\n\\leq |a_n z^{n}|,\n\\]\ncontradiction.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{cor}\nLet \n\\[\nf(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n\n\\]\nbe a polynomial with positive real coefficients. Then every root $z \\in \\CC$ of $f$ satisfies $r \\leq |z| \\leq R$ for\n\\begin{align*}\nr &= \\min\\{a_0/a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}/a_n\\} \\\\\nR &= \\max\\{a_0/a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}/a_n\\}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nThe bound $|z| \\leq R$ follows by applying the lemma to the polynomial $f(x/R)$.\nThe bound $|z| \\geq r$ follows by applying the lemma to the reverse of the polynomial $f(x/r)$.\n\\end{proof}\nSuppose now that $P_i(z) = P_j(z) = 0$ for some $z \\in \\CC$ and some integers $i < j$. \nWe clearly cannot have $j = i+1$, as then $P_i(0) \\neq 0$ and so $P_j(z) - P_i(z) = (i+1) z^i \\neq 0$; we thus have $j-i \\geq 2$.\nBy applying Corollary~2 to $P_i(x)$, we see that $|z| \\leq 1 - \\frac{1}{i}$. On the other hand, by applying Corollary~2 to $(P_j(x) - P_i(x))/x^{i-1}$, we see that $|z| \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{i+2}$, contradiction.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:} Elkies also reports that this problem is his submission, dating back to 2005 and arising from work of Joe Harris.\nIt dates back further to Example 3.7 in: Hajime Kaji,\nOn the tangentially degenerate curves,\n\\textit{J. London Math. Soc. (2)} \\textbf{33} (1986), 430--440, in which the second solution is given.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nElkies points out a mild generalization which may be treated using the first solution but not the second: for integers $a<b<c<d$ and $z \\in \\CC$\nwhich is neither zero nor a root of unity, the matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\na & b & c & d \\\\\nz^a & z^b & z^c & z^d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nhas rank 3 (the problem at hand being the case $a=0, b=1, c=i+1, d=j+1$).\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIt seems likely that the individual polynomials $P_k(x)$ are all irreducible, but this appears difficult to prove.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Third solution:}\n(by David Feldman)\nNote that\n\\[\nP_n(x)(1-x) = 1 + x + \\cdots + x^{n-1} - nx^n.\n\\]\nIf $|z| \\geq 1$, then\n\\[\nn|z|^n \\geq |z|^{n-1} + \\cdots + 1 \\geq |z^{n-1} + \\cdots + 1|,\n\\]\nwith the first equality occurring only if $|z| = 1$ and the second equality occurring only if $z$ is a positive real number. Hence the equation $P_n(z)(1-z) = 0$ has no solutions  with $|z| \\geq 1$ other than the trivial solution $z=1$. Since\n\\[\nP_n(x)(1-x)^2 = 1 - (n+1) x^n + nx^{n+1},\n\\]\nit now suffices to check that the curves\n\\[\nC_n = \\{ z \\in \\CC: 0 < |z| < 1, \\left| z \\right|^n \\left| n+1 - zn \\right| = 1 \\}\n\\]\nare pairwise disjoint as $n$ varies over positive integers.\n\nWrite $z = u+iv$; we may assume without loss of generality that $v \\geq 0$.\nDefine the function\n\\[\nE_z(n) = n \\log |z| + \\log |n+1-zn|.\n\\]\nOne computes that for $n \\in \\RR$, $E_z''(n) < 0$ if and only if\n\\[\n\\frac{u-v-1}{(1-u)^2 + v^2} < n <\n\\frac{u+v-1}{(1-u)^2 + v^2}.\n\\]\nIn addition, $E_z(0) = 0$ and \n\\[\nE_z'(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log (u^2+v^2) + (1-u) \\geq \\log (u) + 1 - u \\geq 0\n\\]\nsince $\\log(u)$ is concave. From this, it follows that the equation $E_z(n) = 0$\ncan have at most one solution with $n>0$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThe reader may notice a strong similarity between this solution and the first solution. The primary difference is we compute that $E'_z(0) \\geq 0$ instead of discovering that $E_z(-1) = 0$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nIt is also possible to solve this problem using a $p$-adic valuation on the field of algebraic numbers in place of the complex absolute value; however, this leads to a substantially more complicated solution. In lieu of including such a solution here,\nwe refer to the approach described by Victor Wang \nhere: \\url{http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=80&t=616731}."
