      "content": "Yes, it follows that $f$ is differentiable.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{First solution.}\nNote first that at $0$, $f/g$ and $g$ are both continuous, as then is their product $f$.\nIf $f(0) \\neq 0$, then in some neighborhood of $0$, $f$ is either always positive or always\nnegative. We can thus choose $\\epsilon \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ so that\n$\\epsilon f$ is the composition of the differentiable function\n$(fg)\\cdot (f/g)$ with the square root function. By the chain rule, $f$ is differentiable at $0$.\n\nIf $f(0) = 0$, then $(f/g)(0) = 0$, so we have\n\\[\n(f/g)'(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0}\n\\frac{f(x)}{x g(x)}.\n\\]\nSince $g$ is continuous at 0, we may multiply limits to deduce that $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x)/x$ exists.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\nChoose a neighborhood $N$ of $0$ on which $g(x) \\neq 0$.\nDefine the following functions on $N \\setminus \\{0\\}$:\n$h_1(x) = \\frac{f(x)g(x)-f(0)g(0)}{x}$;\n$h_2(x) = \\frac{f(x)g(0)-f(0)g(x)}{xg(0)g(x)}$;\n$h_3(x) = g(0)g(x)$;\n$h_4(x) = \\frac{1}{g(x)+g(0)}$. Then\nby assumption, $h_1,h_2,h_3,h_4$ all have limits as $x \\to 0$. On the\nother hand,\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x} = (h_1(x)+h_2(x)h_3(x))h_4(x),\n\\]\nand it follows that $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x}$ exists, as desired."
