Choose a point $P$ in the convex hull of $S$.\nPut $S' = S \\setminus \\{P\\}$;\nby the induction hypothesis, there are at most $\\binom{n-1}{2} + 1$\nlinear partitions of $S'$. Note that each linear partition of $S$ restricts\nto a linear partition of $S'$. Moreover, if two linear partitions of $S$\nrestrict to the same linear partition of $S'$, then that partition of $S'$\nis achieved by a line through $P$.\n\nBy rotating a line through $P$, we see that there are at most $n-1$\npartitions of $S'$ achieved by lines through $P$: namely, the partition only\nchanges when the rotating line passes through one of the points of $S$.\nThis yields the desired result.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:} (by Noam Elkies) We enlarge the plane to a projective\nplane by adding a line at infinity, then apply the polar duality map\ncentered at one of the points $O \\in S$. This turns the rest of $S$ into\na set $S'$ of $n-1$ lines in the dual projective plane. Let $O'$ be the\npoint in the dual plane corresponding to the original line at infinity;\nit does not lie on any of the lines in $S'$.\n\nLet $\\ell$ be a line in the original plane, corresponding to a point $P$ in\nthe dual plane. If we form the linear partition induced by $\\ell$, then\nthe points of $S \\setminus \\{O\\}$ lying in the same part as $O$\ncorrespond to the lines of $S'$ which cross the segment $O'P$.\nIf we consider the dual affine plane as being divided into regions by\nthe lines of $S'$, then the lines of $S'$ crossing the segment $O'P$\nare determined by which region $P$ lies in.\n\nThus our original maximum is equal to the maximum number of regions into\nwhich $n-1$ lines divide an affine plane. By induction on $n$, this number\nis easily seen to be $1 + \\binom{n}{2}$.\n\n\\textbf{Fourth solution:} (by Florian Herzig)\nSay that an \\emph{$S$-line} is a line that intersects $S$ in at least two points.\nWe claim that the nontrivial linear partitions of $S$ are in natural bijection with pairs\n$(\\ell, \\{X,Y\\})$ consisting of an $S$-line $\\ell$ and a nontrivial linear partition $\\{X,Y\\}$ of $\\ell \\cap S$.\nSince an $S$-line $\\ell$ admits precisely $|\\ell\\cap S|-1 \\le \\binom{|\\ell \\cap S|}{2}$ nontrivial linear partitions,\nthe claim implies that $L_S \\le \\binom n2 + 1$ with equality iff no three points of $S$ are collinear.\n\nLet $P$ be the line at infinity in the real projective plane. Given any nontrivial linear partition $\\{A,B\\}$ of $S$, the\nset of lines inducing this partition is a proper, open, connected subset $I$ of $P$. (It is proper because it has to omit\ndirections of $S$-lines that pass through both parts of the partition and open because we can vary the separating line. It is\nconnected because if we have two such lines that aren't parallel, we can rotate through their point of intersection to\nget all intermediate directions.) Among all $S$-lines that intersect both $A$ and $B$ choose a line $\\ell$ whose direction is\nminimal (in the clockwise direction) with respect to the interval $I$; also, pick an arbitrary line $\\ell'$ that induces\n$\\{A,B\\}$. By rotating $\\ell'$ clockwise to $\\ell$ about their point of intersection, we see that the direction\nof $\\ell$ is the least upper bound of $I$. (We can't hit any point of $S$ during the rotation because of the minimality\nproperty of $\\ell$.)  The line $\\ell$ is in fact unique because if the (parallel) lines $pq$ and $rs$ are two choices for $\\ell$,\nwith $p$, $q \\in A$; $r$, $s \\in B$, then one of the diagonals $ps$, $qr$ would contradict the minimality property of\n$\\ell$. To define the above bijection we send $\\{A,B\\}$ to $(\\ell, \\{A \\cap \\ell, B \\cap \\ell\\})$.\n\nConversely, suppose that we are given an $S$-line $\\ell$ and a nontrivial linear partition $\\{X,Y\\}$ of $\\ell \\cap S$.\nPick any point $p \\in \\ell$ that induces the partition $\\{X,Y\\}$. If we rotate the line $\\ell$ about $p$ in the counterclockwise\ndirection by a sufficiently small amount, we get a nontrivial linear partitition of $S$ that is independent of all choices.\n(It is obtained from the partition of $S-\\ell$ induced by $\\ell$ by adjoining $X$ to one part and $Y$ to the other.) This\ndefines a map in the other direction.\n\nBy construction these two maps are inverse to each other, and this proves the claim.\n\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nGiven a finite set $S$ of points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, a \\emph{non-Radon partition}\nof $S$ is a pair $(A,B)$\nof complementary subsets that can be separated by\na hyperplane. \\emph{Radon's theorem} states that if $\\#S\\geq n+2$, then not\nevery $(A,B)$ is a non-Radon partition. The result of this problem\nhas been greatly\nextended, especially within the context of matroid theory and oriented\nmatroid theory. Richard Stanley suggests the following references:\nT. H. Brylawski, A combinatorial\nperspective on the Radon convexity theorem, \\emph{Geom. Ded.} \\textbf{5}\n(1976),\n459-466; and T. Zaslavsky, Extremal arrangements of hyperplanes,\n\\emph{Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.} \\textbf{440} (1985), 69-87."
