      "content": "\\textbf{First solution:}\nBy the linearity of expectation, the average number of local maxima is equal\nto the sum of the probability of having a local maximum at $k$ over\n$k=1,\\dots, n$.\nFor $k=1$, this probability is 1/2: given the pair\n$\\{\\pi(1), \\pi(2)\\}$, it is equally likely that $\\pi(1)$ or $\\pi(2)$ is\nbigger. Similarly, for $k=n$, the probability is 1/2. For $1 < k < n$,\nthe probability is 1/3: given the pair $\\{\\pi(k-1), \\pi(k), \\pi(k+1)\\}$,\nit is equally likely that any of the three is the largest.\nThus the average number of local maxima is\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + (n-2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} =\n\\frac{n+1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\nAnother way to apply the linearity of expectation is to compute the\nprobability that $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ occurs as a local maximum.\nThe most efficient way to do this is to imagine the permutation\nas consisting of the symbols $1, \\dots, n, *$ written in a circle in\nsome order. The number $i$ occurs as a local maximum if the two symbols\nit is adjacent to both belong to the set $\\{*, 1, \\dots, i-1\\}$. There are\n$i(i-1)$ pairs of such symbols and $n(n-1)$ pairs in total, so the\nprobability of $i$ occurring as a local maximum is $i(i-1)/(n(n-1))$, and\nthe average number of local maxima is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{i(i-1)}{n(n-1)} &=\n\\frac{2}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\binom{i}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{n(n-1)} \\binom{n+1}{3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{n+1}{3}.\n\\end{align*}\nOne can obtain a similar (if slightly more intricate)\nsolution inductively, by removing the known\nlocal maximum $n$ and splitting into two shorter sequences.\n\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nThe usual term for a local maximum in this sense is a \\emph{peak}.\nThe complete distribution for the number of peaks is known;\nRichard Stanley suggests the reference:\nF.
