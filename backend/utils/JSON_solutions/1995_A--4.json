      "content": "Let $s_{k} = x_{1} + \\cdots + x_{k} - k(n-1)/n$, so that $s_{n} =\ns_{0} = 0$. These form a cyclic sequence that doesn't change when you\nrotate the necklace, except that the entire sequence gets translated\nby a constant. In particular, it makes sense to choose $x_{i}$ for\nwhich $s_{i}$ is maximum and make that one $x_{n}$; this way $s_{i}\n\\leq 0$ for all $i$, which gives $x_{1} + \\cdots + x_{i} \\leq\ni(n-1)/n$, but the right side may be replaced by $i-1$ since the left\nside is an integer."
