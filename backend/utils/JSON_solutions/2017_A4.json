Let $i$ be the largest index for which $s_i \\leq 7.4N$;\nnote that we cannot have $i = N$, as otherwise $s_0 = s_N = 7.4N$ and hence \n$a_1 = \\cdots = a_{2N} = 7.4$, contradiction.\nThen $7.4N - s_i < s_{i+1} - s_i = a_{i+N+1} - a_i$ and so\n\\[\na_i < s_i + a_{i+N+1} - 7.4N \\leq a_{i+N+1};\n\\]\nsince all possible scores occur, this means that we can find $N$ scores with sum $7.4N$\nby taking $a_{i+1}, \\dots, a_{i+N+1}$ and omitting one occurrence of the value $s_i + a_{i+N+1} - 7.4N$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nDavid Savitt (via Art of Problem Solving) points out that a similar argument applies provided that\nthere are an even number of students, the total score is even, and the achieved scores form a block of consecutive integers.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution.}\nWe first claim that for any integer $m$ with $15 \\leq m \\leq 40$, we can find five distinct elements of the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ whose sum is $m$. Indeed, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 4$ and $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 6$, we have\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^k j \\right) + (k+\\ell) + \\left(\\sum_{j=k+7}^{10} j \\right) = 34-5k+\\ell,\\]\nand for fixed $k$ this takes all values from $35-5k$ to $40-5k$ inclusive; then as $k$ ranges from $0$ to $4$, this takes all values from $15$ to $40$ inclusive.\n\nNow suppose that the scores are $a_1,\\ldots,a_{2N}$, where we order the scores so that $a_k=k$ for $k \\leq 10$ and the subsequence $a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{2N}$ is nondecreasing. For $1 \\leq k \\leq N-4$, define $S_k = \\sum_{j=k+10}^{k+N+4} a_j$. Note that for each $k$, $S_{k+1}-S_k = a_{k+N+5}-a_{k+10}$ and so $0 \\leq S_{k+1}-S_k \\leq 10$. Thus $S_1,\\ldots,S_{N-4}$ is a nondecreasing sequence of integers where each term is at most $10$ more than the previous one. On the other hand, we have \n\\begin{align*}\nS_1 + S_{N-4} &= \\sum_{j=11}^{2N} a_j \\\\\n&= (7.4)(2N)-\\sum_{j=1}^{10} a_j \\\\\n&= (7.4)(2N)-55,\n\\end{align*}\nwhence $S_1 \\leq 7.4N-27.5 \\leq S_{N-4}$. It follows that there is some $k$ such that $S_k \\in [7.4N-40, 7.4N-15]$, since this interval has length $25$ and $7.4N-27.5$ lies inside it.\n\n\nFor this value of $k$, note that both $S_k$ and $7.4N$ are integers (the latter since the sum of all scores in the class is the integer $(7.4)(2N)$ and so $N$ must be divisible by $5$). Thus there is an integer $m$ with $15 \\leq m \\leq 40$ for which $S_k = 7.4N-m$. By our first claim, we can choose five scores from $a_1,\\ldots,a_{10}$ whose sum is $m$. When we add these to the sum of the $N-5$ scores $a_{k+10},\\ldots,a_{k+N+4}$, we get precisely $7.4N$. We have now found $N$ scores whose sum is $7.4N$ and thus whose average is $7.4$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Third solution.}\nIt will suffices to show that given any partition of the students into two groups of $N$, if the sums are not equal we can bring them closer together by swapping one pair of students between the two groups. To state this symbolically,\nlet $S$ be the set of students and, for any subset $T$ of $S$, let $\\Sigma T$ denote the sum of the scores of the students in $T$; we then show that if $S = A \\cup B$ is a partition into two $N$-element sets with\n$\\Sigma A > \\Sigma B$, then there exist students $a \\in A, B \\in B$ such that the sets\n\\[\nA' = A \\setminus \\{a\\} \\cup \\{b\\}, \\qquad\nB' = A \\setminus \\{b\\} \\cup \\{a\\}\n\\]\nsatisfy\n\\[\n0 \\leq \\Sigma A' - \\Sigma B' < \\Sigma A - \\Sigma B.\n\\]\nIn fact, this argument will apply at the same level of generality as in the remark following the first solution.\n\nTo prove the claim, let \n$a_1,\\dots,a_n$ be the scores in $A$ and let $b_1,\\dots,b_n$ be the scores in $B$ (in any order).\nSince $\\Sigma A - \\Sigma B \\equiv \\Sigma S \\pmod{2}$ and the latter is even, we must have\n$\\Sigma A - \\Sigma B \\geq 2$.\nIn particular, there must exist indices $i,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ such that $a_i > b_j$.\nConsequently, if we sort the sequence $a_1,\\dots,a_n,b_1,\\dots,b_n$ into nondecreasing order,\nit must be the case that some term $b_j$ is followed by some term $a_i$.\nMoreover, since the achieved scores form a range of consecutive integers, we must in fact have\n$a_i = b_j + 1$. Consequently, if we take $a = a_i$, $b = b_j$, we then have\n$\\Sigma A' - \\Sigma' B = \\Sigma A - \\Sigma B - 2$, which proves the claim."
