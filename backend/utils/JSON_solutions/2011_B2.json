      "content": "Only the primes 2 and 5 appear seven or more times.\nThe fact that these primes appear is demonstrated by the examples\n\\[\n(2,5,2), (2, 5, 3),  (2, 7, 5), (2, 11, 5)\n\\]\nand their reversals.\n\nIt remains to show that if either $\\ell=3$ or $\\ell$ is a prime greater than 5, then $\\ell$ occurs at most six times\nas an element of a triple in $S$.\nNote that $(p,q,r) \\in S$ if and only if\n$q^2 - 4pr = a^2$ for some integer $a$; in particular, since $4pr \\geq 16$, this forces $q \\geq 5$.\nIn particular, $q$ is odd, as then is $a$, and so $q^2 \\equiv a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$;\nconsequently, one of $p,r$ must equal 2. If $r=2$, then $8p = q^2-a^2 = (q+a)(q-a)$; since both factors\nare of the same sign and their sum is the positive number $2q$, both factors are positive.\nSince they are also both even, we have $q+a \\in \\{2, 4, 2p, 4p\\}$ and so\n$q \\in \\{2p+1, p+2\\}$. Similarly, if $p=2$, then $q \\in \\{2r+1, r+2\\}$.\nConsequently, $\\ell$ occurs at most twice as many times as there are prime numbers in the list\n\\[\n2\\ell+1, \\ell+2, \\frac{\\ell-1}{2}, \\ell-2.\n\\]\nFor $\\ell = 3$,$\\ell-2= 1$ is not prime.\nFor $\\ell \\geq 7$, the numbers $\\ell-2, \\ell, \\ell+2$ cannot all be prime,\nsince one of them is always a nontrivial multiple of 3.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nThe above argument shows that the cases listed for 5 are the only ones that can occur. By contrast,\nthere are infinitely many cases where 2 occurs if either the twin prime conjecture holds or there are\ninfinitely many Sophie Germain primes (both of which are expected to be true)."
