The distances $a,b,c$ are then $|x-1|,|x-\\omega|,|x-\\omega^2|$.\nNow the identity\n\\[\n(x-1) + \\omega(x-\\omega) + \\omega^2(x-\\omega^2) = 0\n\\]\nimplies that there is a triangle whose sides, as vectors, correspond\nto the complex numbers $x-1, \\omega(x-\\omega), \\omega^2(x-\\omega^2)$;\nthis triangle has sides of length $a,b,c$.\n\nTo calculate the area of this triangle, we first note a more general\nformula. If a triangle in the plane has vertices at $0$,\n$v_1=s_1+it_1$, $v_2=s_2+it_2$, then it is well known that the area\nof the triangle is $|s_1t_2-s_2t_1|/2 = |v_1\\overline{v_2}-\nv_2\\overline{v_1}|/4$. In our case, we have $v_1 = x-1$\nand $v_2 = \\omega(x-\\omega)$; then\n\\[\nv_1\\overline{v_2} - v_2\\overline{v_1}\n= (\\omega^2-\\omega)(x\\overline{x}-1)\n= i\\sqrt{3}(|x|^2-1).\n\\]\nHence the area of the triangle is $\\sqrt{3}(1-|x|^2)/4$, which depends\nonly on the distance $|x|$ from $P$ to $O$.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:} (by Florian Herzig)\nLet $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ be the points obtained by intersecting the lines\n$AP$, $BP$, $CP$ with the unit circle. Let $d$ denote $OP$. Then $A'P =\n(1-d^2)/a$, etc., by using the power of the point $P$. As triangles $A'B'P$\nand $BAP$ are similar, we get that $A'B' = AB \\cdot A'P/b = \\sqrt 3\n(1-d^2)/(ab)$. It follows that triangle $A'B'C'$ has sides proportional\nto $a$, $b$, $c$, by a factor of $\\sqrt 3 (1-d^2)/(abc)$. In particular,\nthere is a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$, and it has circumradius $R =\n(abc)/(\\sqrt 3 (1-d^2))$. Its area is $abc/(4R) = \\sqrt 3 (1-d^2)/4$.\n\n\\textbf{Third solution:} (by Samuel Li)\nConsider the rotation by the angle $\\pi/3$ around $A$ carrying $B$ to $C$, and let $P_A$ be the image of $P$;\ndefine $P_B, P_C$ similarly.\nLet $A'$ be the intersection of the tangents to the circle at $B, C$; define $B', C'$, similarly.\nPut $\\ell = AB = BC = CA$; we then have\n\\begin{gather*}\nAB' = AC' = BC' = BA' = CA' = CB' = \\ell \\\\\nPA = PP_A = P_A A = P_B C' = P_C A' = a \\\\\nPB = PP_B = P_B B = P_C A' = P_A C' = b \\\\\nPC = PP_C = P_C C = P_A B' = P_B A' = c.\n\\end{gather*}\n\nThe triangle $\\triangle A'B'C'$ has area four times that of $\\triangle ABC$.\nWe may dissect it into twelve triangles by first splitting it into three quadrilaterals $PAC'B$, $PBC'A, PCA'B$, then splitting each of these in four around the respective interior points $P_B, P_C, P_A$. \nOf the resulting twelve triangles, three have side lengths $a,b,c$, while three are equilateral triangles\nof respective sides lengths $a,b,c$. The other six are isomorphic to two copies each of\n$\\triangle PAB, \\triangle PBC, \\triangle PCA$, so their total area is twice that of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nIt thus suffices to compute $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ in terms of the radius of the circle and the distance $OP$.\nThis can be done readily in terms of\n$OP$ using vectors, Cartesian coordinates, or complex numbers as in the first solution."
