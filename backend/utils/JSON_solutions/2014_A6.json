      "content": "The largest such $k$ is $n^n$. We first show that this value can be achieved by an explicit construction.\nLet $e_1,\\dots,e_n$ be the standard basis of $\\RR^n$.\nFor $i_1,\\dots,i_n \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, let $M_{i_1,\\dots,i_n}$ be the matrix with row vectors $e_{i_1},\\dots,e_{i_n}$, and let $N_{i_1,\\dots,i_n}$ be the transpose of $M_{i_1,\\dots,i_n}$. Then $M_{i_1,\\dots,i_n} N_{j_1,\\dots,j_n}$ has $k$-th diagonal entry $e_{i_k} \\cdot e_{j_k}$, proving the claim.\n\nWe next show that for any families of matrices $M_i, N_j$ as described, we must have $k \\leq n^n$.\nLet $V$ be the \\emph{$n$-fold tensor product} of $\\RR^n$, i.e., the vector space with  orthonormal basis\n$e_{i_1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{i_n}$ for $i_1,\\dots,i_n \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\nLet $m_i$ be the tensor product of the rows of $M_i$; that is,\n\\[\nm_i = \\sum_{i_1,\\dots,i_n=1}^n (M_i)_{1,i_1} \\cdots (M_i)_{n,i_n} e_{i_1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{i_n}.\n\\]\nSimilarly, let $n_j$ be the tensor product of the columns of $N_j$. One computes easily that $m_i \\cdot n_j$ equals the product of the diagonal entries of $M_i N_j$,\nand so vanishes if and only if $i \\neq j$. For any $c_i \\in \\RR$ such that $\\sum_i c_i m_i = 0$, for each $j$ we have \n\\[\n0 = \\left(\\sum_i c_i m_i\\right) \\cdot n_j = \\sum_i c_i (m_i \\cdot n_j) = c_j.\n\\]\nTherefore the vectors $m_1,\\dots,m_k$ in $V$ are linearly independent, implying $k \\leq n^n$ as desired.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nNoam Elkies points out that similar argument may be made in the case that the $M_i$ are $m \\times n$ matrices and the $N_j$ are $n \\times m$ matrices."
