      "content": "\\textbf{First solution:}\nChoose a set of $a$ rows $r_1, \\dots, r_a$\ncontaining an $a \\times b$ submatrix whose\nentries are all 1. Then for $i,j \\in\\{1, \\dots, a\\}$, we have\n$r_i \\cdot r_j = n$ if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise. Hence\n\\[\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^a r_i \\cdot r_j = an.\n\\]\nOn the other hand, the term on the left is the dot product of\n$r_1 + \\cdots + r_a$ with itself, i.e., its squared length. Since\nthis vector has $a$ in each of its first $b$ coordinates, the dot product\nis at least $a^2 b$. Hence $an \\geq a^2 b$,\nwhence $n \\geq ab$ as desired.\n\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by Richard Stanley)\nSuppose without loss of generality that the $a \\times b$ submatrix\noccupies the first $a$ rows and the first $b$ columns.\nLet $M$ be the submatrix occupying the first $a$ rows and the last\n$n-b$ columns. Then the hypothesis implies that the matrix\n$MM^T$ has $n-b$'s on the main diagonal and $-b$'s elsewhere.\nHence the column vector $v$ of length $a$ consisting of all 1's\nsatisfies $MM^T v = (n-ab)v$, so $n-ab$ is an eigenvalue of $MM^T$.\nBut $MM^T$ is semidefinite, so its eigenvalues are all nonnegative\nreal numbers. Hence $n-ab \\geq 0$.\n\n\\textbf{Remarks:}\nA matrix as in the problem is called a \\emph{Hadamard matrix}, because\nit meets the equality condition of Hadamard's inequality:\nany $n \\times n$ matrix with $\\pm 1$ entries has absolute determinant\nat most $n^{n/2}$, with equality if and only if the rows are mutually\northogonal\n(from the interpretation of the determinant as the volume of a paralellepiped\nwhose edges are parallel to the row vectors).\nNote that this implies  that the columns are also mutually orthogonal.\nA generalization of this problem, with a similar proof, is known\nas \\emph{Lindsey's lemma}: the sum of the entries in any\n$a \\times b$ submatrix of a Hadamard matrix is at most $\\sqrt{abn}$.\nStanley notes that Ryser (1981) asked for the smallest size of a Hadamard\nmatrix containing an $r \\times s$ submatrix of all 1's, and refers to\nthe URL \\texttt{www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/ abstract/110550861/ABSTRACT} for more information."
