      "content": "We first rule out the case $|a|>1$. In this case, we prove that $|x_{n+1}| \\geq |x_n|$ for all $n$, meaning that we cannot have $x_n = 0$. We proceed by induction; the claim is true for $n=0,1$ by hypothesis. To prove the claim for  $n \\geq 2$, write\n\\begin{align*}\n|x_{n+1}| &= |2x_nx_{n-1}-x_{n-2}| \\\\\n&\\geq 2|x_n||x_{n-1}|-|x_{n-2}| \\\\\n&\\geq |x_n|(2|x_{n-1}|-1) \\geq |x_n|,\n\\end{align*} \nwhere the last step follows from $|x_{n-1}| \\geq |x_{n-2}| \\geq \\cdots \\geq |x_0| = 1$.\n\nWe may thus assume hereafter that $|a|\\leq 1$. We can then write $a = \\cos b$ for some $b \\in [0,\\pi]$. \nLet $\\{F_n\\}$ be the Fibonacci sequence, defined as usual by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$. We show by induction that\n\\[\nx_n = \\cos(F_n b) \\qquad (n \\geq 0).\n\\]\nIndeed, this is true for $n=0,1,2$; given that it is true for $n \\leq m$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n2x_mx_{m-1}&=2\\cos(F_mb)\\cos(F_{m-1}b) \\\\\n&= \\cos((F_m-F_{m-1})b)+\\cos((F_m+F_{m-1})b) \\\\\n&= \\cos(F_{m-2}b)+\\cos(F_{m+1}b)\n\\end{align*}\nand so \n$x_{m+1} = 2x_mx_{m-1}-x_{m-2} = \\cos(F_{m+1}b)$. This completes the induction.\n\n\nSince $x_n = \\cos(F_n b)$, if $x_n=0$ for some $n$ then $F_n b = \\frac{k}{2} \\pi$ for some odd integer $k$. In particular, we can write $b = \\frac{c}{d}(2\\pi)$ where $c = k$ and $d = 4F_n$ are integers.\n\n\nLet $x_n$ denote the pair $(F_n,F_{n+1})$, where each entry in this pair is viewed as an element of $\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z}$. Since there are only finitely many possibilities for $x_n$, there must be some $n_2>n_1$ such that $x_{n_1}=x_{n_2}$. Now $x_n$ uniquely determines both $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n-1}$, and it follows that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is periodic: for $\\ell = n_2-n_1$, $x_{n+\\ell} = x_n$ for all $n \\geq 0$. In particular, $F_{n+\\ell} \\equiv F_n \\pmod{d}$ for all $n$. But then $\\frac{F_{n+\\ell}c}{d}-\\frac{F_n c}{d}$ is an integer, and so\n\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+\\ell} &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{F_{n+\\ell}c}{d}(2\\pi)\\right)\\\\\n& = \\cos\\left(\\frac{F_n c}{d}(2\\pi)\\right) = x_n\n\\end{align*}\nfor all $n$. Thus the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is periodic, as desired.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nKarl Mahlburg points out that one can motivate the previous solution by computing the terms\n\\[\nx_2 = 2a^2 - 1, x_3 = 4a^3 - 3a, x_4 = 16a^5 - 20a^3 + 5a\n\\]\nand recognizing these as the Chebyshev polynomials $T_2, T_3, T_5$. (Note that $T_3$ was used in the solution of\nproblem A3.)\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nIt is not necessary to handle the case $\\left| a \\right| > 1$ separately; the cosine function extends\nto a surjective analytic function on $\\mathbb{C}$ and continues to satisfy the addition formula,\nso one can write $a = \\cos b$ for some $b \\in \\mathbb{C}$\nand then proceed as above."
