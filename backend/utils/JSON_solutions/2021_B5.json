      "content": "For convenience, throughout we work with matrices over the field of 2 elements. In this language, if there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1} A P$ is unipotent (i.e., has 1s on the main diagonal and 0s below it), then $A$ is very odd: any principal submatrix of $A$ is conjugate to a principal submatrix of $P^{-1} A P$, which is again unipotent and in particular nonsingular.\nWe will solve the problem by showing that conversely, for any very odd matrix $A$, there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1} A P$ is unipotent. Since the latter condition is preserved by taking powers, this will prove the desired result.\n\nTo begin, we may take $S = \\{i\\}$ to see that $a_{ii} = 1$. We next form a (loopless) directed graph on the vertex set $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ with an edge from $i$ to $j$ whenever $a_{ij} = 1$, and claim that this graph has no cycles.\nTo see this, suppose the contrary,\nchoose a cycle of minimal length $m \\geq 2$, and let $i_1,\\dots,i_m$ be the vertices in order.\nThe minimality of the cycle implies that\n\\[\na_{i_j i_k} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\mbox{if } k - j \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\pmod{m} \\\\\n0 & \\mbox{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe submatrix corresponding to $S = \\{i_1,\\dots,i_m\\}$ has row sum 0 and hence is singular, a contradiction.\n\nWe now proceed by induction on $n$.\nSince the directed graph has no cycles, there must be some vertex which is not the starting point of any edge\n(e.g., the endpoint of any path of maximal length).\nWe may conjugate by a permutation matrix so that this vertex becomes 1. We now apply the induction hypothesis to the submatrix corresponding to $S = \\{2,\\dots,n\\}$ to conclude.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nA directed graph without cycles, as in our solution, is commonly called a \\emph{DAG (directed acyclic graph)}. It is a standard fact that a directed graph is a TAG if and only if there is a linear ordering of its vertices consistent with all edge directions.\nSee for example \\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph}.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark.}\nAn $n \\times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ for which the value of $a_{ij}$ depends only on $i-j \\pmod{n}$ is called a \\emph{circulant matrix}.\nThe circulant matrix with first row $(1,1,0,\\dots,0)$ is an example of an $n \\times n$ matrix whose determinant is even, but whose other principal minors are all odd."
