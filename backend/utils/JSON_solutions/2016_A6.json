      "content": "We prove that the smallest such value of $C$ is $5/6$.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{First solution:}\n(based on a suggestion of Daniel Kane)\n\nWe first reduce to the case where $P$ is nonnegative in $[0,1]$ and $P(0) = 0$.\nTo achieve this reduction, suppose that a given value $C$ obeys the inequality for such $P$.\nFor $P$ general,\ndivide the interval $[0,1]$ into subintervals $I_1,\\dots,I_k$ at the roots of $P$.\nWrite $\\ell(I_i)$ for the length of the interval $I_i$; since each interval is bounded by a root of $P$, we may make a linear change of variable to see that\n\\[\n\\int_{I_i} |P(x)|\\,dx \\leq C \\ell(I_i) \\max_{x \\in I_i} |P(x)| \\quad (i=1,\\dots,k).\n\\]\nSumming over $i$ yields the desired inequality.\n\nSuppose now that $P$ takes nonnegative values on $[0,1]$, $P(0) = 0$, and $\\max_{x \\in [0,1]} P(x) = 1$. Write $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx$ for some $a,b,c \\in \\RR$; then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx &= \\frac{1}{4} a + \\frac{1}{3} b + \\frac{1}{2} c \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{8} a + \\frac{1}{4} b + \\frac{1}{2} c \\right)\n+ \\frac{1}{6} (a+b+c) \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{3} P\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{6} P(1) \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}.\n\\end{align*}\nConsequently, the originally claimed inequality holds with $C = 5/6$. To prove that this value is best possible, it suffices to exhibit a polynomial $P$ as above with $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx = 5/6$; we will verify that\n\\[\nP(x) = 4x^3 - 8x^2 + 5x\n\\]\nhas this property. It is apparent that $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\, dx =5/6$.\nSince $P'(x) = (2x-1)(6x-5)$ and \n\\[\nP(0) = 0, \\,P\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = 1, \\,\nP\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) = \\frac{25}{27}, P(1) = 1,\n\\]\nit follows that $P$ increases from 0 at $x=0$ to 1 at $x=1/2$, then decreases to a positive value at $x=5/6$, then increases to 1 at $x=1$. Hence $P$ has the desired form.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Remark:}\nHere is some conceptual motivation for the preceding solution.\nLet $V$ be the set of polynomials of degree at most 3 vanishing at 0, viewed as a three-dimensional vector space over $\\RR$.\nLet $S$ be the subset of $V$ consisting of those polynomials $P(x)$ for which\n$0 \\leq P(x) \\leq 1$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$; this set is convex and compact. We may then compute the minimal $C$ as the maximum value of $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx$ over all $P \\in S$, provided that the maximum is achieved for some polynomial of degree exactly 3. (Note that any extremal polynomial must satisfy\n$\\max_{x \\in [0,1]} P(x) = 1$, as otherwise we could multiply it by some constant $c>1$ so as to increase $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx$.)\n\nLet $f: V \\to \\RR$ be the function taking $P(x)$ to $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx$. This function is linear, so we can characterize its extrema on $S$ easily: there exist exactly two level surfaces for $f$ which are supporting planes for $S$, and the intersections of these two planes\nwith $S$ are the minima and the maxima. It is obvious that the unique minimum is achieved by the zero polynomial, so this accounts for one of the planes.\n\nIt thus suffices to exhibit a single polynomial $P(x) \\in S$ such that the level plane of $f$ through $P$ is a supporting plane for $S$. \nThe calculation made in the solution amounts to verifying that\n\\[\nP(x) = 4x^3 - 8x^2 + 5x\n\\]\nhas this property, by interpolating between the constraints $P(1/2) \\leq 1$ and $P(1) \\leq 1$.\n\nThis still leaves the matter of correctly guessing the optimal polynomial. If one supposes that it should be extremized both at $x=1$ and at an interval value of the disc, it is forced to have the form $P(x) = 1 + (x-1)(cx-1)^2$ for some $c>0$; the interpolation property then pins down $c$ uniquely.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Second solution:}\n(by James Merryfield, via AoPS)\nAs in the first solution, we may assume that $P$ is nonnegative on $[0,1]$ and $P(0)= 0$.\nSince $P$ has degree at most 3, Simpson's rule for approximating $\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx$ is an exact formula:\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 P(x)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{6}( P(0) + 4 P\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + P(1)).\n\\]\nThis immediately yields the claimed inequality for $C = 5/6$. Again as in the first solution,\nwe obtain an example showing that this value is best possible."
