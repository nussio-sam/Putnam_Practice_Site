      "content": "The coefficient of $x^n$ in the Taylor series of $(1-x+x^2)e^x$ for \n$n=0,1,2$ is $1,0,\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively. For $n\\geq 3$, the coefficient of \n$x^n$ is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{n!} - \\frac{1}{(n-1)!} + \\frac{1}{(n-2)!}\n&= \\frac{1-n+n(n-1)}{n!} \\\\\n&= \\frac{n-1}{n(n-2)!}.\n\\end{align*}\nIf $n-1$ is prime, then the lowest-terms numerator is clearly either 1 or the prime $n-1$ (and in fact the latter, since $n-1$ is relatively prime to $n$ and to $(n-2)!$).\n If $n-1$ is composite,\neither it can be written as $ab$ for some $a \\neq b$, in which case both $a$ and $b$ appear separately in $(n-2)!$ and so the numerator is $1$,\nor $n-1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, in which case $p$ appears in $(n-2)!$\nand so the numerator is either 1 or $p$. (In the latter case, the numerator is actually 1 unless $p=2$, as in all other cases both $p$ and $2p$ appear in $(n-2)!$.)"
